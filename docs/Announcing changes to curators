Possible reasons for obsoletions: 
* The reason for obsoletion is that there is no evidence that this function/process/component exists. (eg: GO:0019562 L-phenylalanine catabolic process to phosphoenolpyruvate; GO:0097605 regulation of nuclear envelope permeabilityâ€™; GO:0015993 molecular hydrogen transport)
* The reason for obsoletion is that the term is not clearly defined and usage has been inconsistent (eg: GO:0030818 negative regulation of cAMP biosynthetic process)
* The reason for obsoletion is that this term represent a GO-CAM model. (eg: GO:0072317 glucan endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidase activity involved in ascospore release from ascus; GO:0100060 negative regulation of SREBP signaling pathway by DNA binding)
* The reason for obsoletion is that this term represent an assay and not a real process. (eg: GO:0035826	rubidium ion transport)
* The reason for obsoletion is that the data from the paper for which the term was requested can be accurately described using [appropriate GO term]. (eg: GO:0015032 storage protein import into fat body)
