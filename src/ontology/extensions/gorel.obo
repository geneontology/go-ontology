BMC Bioinformatics, 15(1), 155. doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-155\n\nNotes on release edition (gorel.owl):\n\nThis ontology is created by merging the relevant subset of RO together with GO-specific annotations of RO relations, and GOREL relations\n\nNotes on editors version (gorel-edit.owl): \nThe editors version imports ro.owl, and allows addition of new relations (GOREL ID space) and annotation of existing RO relations. Note for editors: if an RO relation is to be made visible in the final gorel product, then make the relation a SubProperty of 'go annotation extension relation'. Anything with a logical axiom is included in the final module. Consult Makefile for details" xsd:string

comment: Example of use: an annotation of gene X to cell proliferation with acts_on_population_of CL:0000057 means that gene X is involved in the proliferation of fibroblasts.

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string

def: "a relation between a specifically dependent continuant (the characteristic) and any other entity (the bearer), in which the characteristic depends on the bearer for its existence." []
comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.

comment: Previous definition "p has_input c if and only c participates_in p at the start of p and c is in some way bound, transported, modified, consumed or destroyed by p." If it is known whether the entity is directly or indirectly bound/acted upon by the gene product that is the subject of the annotation, then the relations has_direct_input or has_indirect_input should be alternatively considered.

comment: DEPRECATION WARNING: The GO editors have agreed that this relation should be deprecated. There are two main reasons for this 1. The relation does not extend the meaning of the GO term, as annotation relations are meant to, but instead specifies conditions under which the annotation is true. This can not be expressed in OWL. Annotation extensions using this relation will never fold. 2. The relation includes a hidden negation. This is problematic for a number of reasons, the most important of which is that burying negations in otherwise positive relationships can cause serious problems for inference.
comment: This relation was obsoleted because it does not follow GO-CAM specifications.

Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string
