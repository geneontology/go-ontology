comment: Genetic variations can span any level of granularity from a full genome or genotype to an individual gene  or sequence alteration.  These variations can be represented at the physical level (DNA/RNA macromolecules or their parts, as in the ChEBI ontology and Molecular Sequence Ontology) or at the abstract level (generically dependent continuant sequence features that are carried by these macromolecules, as in the Sequence Ontology and Genotype Ontology).  The causal relations in this hierarchy can be used in linking either physical or abstract genetic variations to phenotypes or diseases they cause or contribute to. \n\nEnvironmental exposures include those imposed by natural environments, experimentally applied conditions, or clinical interventions.

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string

These variations can be represented at the physical level (DNA/RNA macromolecules or their parts, as in the ChEBI ontology and Molecular Sequence Ontology) or at the abstract level (generically dependent continuant sequence features that are carried by these macromolecules, as in the Sequence Ontology and Genotype Ontology).  The causal relations in this hierarchy can be used in linking either physical or abstract genetic variations to phenotypes or diseases they cause or contribute to.\n\nEnvironmental exposures include those imposed by natural environments, experimentally applied conditions, or clinical interventions.

Hence containment is not a transitive relation.    If c part_of c1 at t then we have also, by our definition and by the axioms of mereology applied to spatial regions, c located_in c1 at t. Thus, many examples of instance-level location relations for continuants are in fact cases of instance-level parthood. For material continuants location and parthood coincide. Containment is location not involving parthood, and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved. To understand this relation, we first define overlap for continuants as follows:    c1 overlap c2 at t =def for some c, c part_of c1 at t and c part_of c2 at t.

comment: By convention GO molecular functions are classified by their effector function and internal regulatory functions are treated as components.

comment: DEPRECATION WARNING: The GO editors have agreed that this relation should be deprecated. There are two main reasons for this 1. The relation does not extend the meaning of the GO term, as annotation relations are meant to, but instead specifies conditions under which the annotation is true. This can not be expressed in OWL. Annotation extensions using this relation will never fold. 2. The relation includes a hidden negation. This is problematic for a number of reasons, the most important of which is that burying negations in otherwise positive relationships can cause serious problems for inference.

def: "Identifies an entity that was shown not to be required for the ontology term to apply to the annotated gene product." [GOA:rph]
comment: DEPRECATION WARNING: The GO editors have agreed that this relation should be deprecated. There are two main reasons for this 1. The relation does not extend the meaning of the GO term, as annotation relations are meant to, but instead specifies conditions under which the annotation is true. This can not be expressed in OWL. Annotation extensions using this relation will never fold. 2. The relation includes a hidden negation. This is problematic for a number of reasons, the most important of which is that burying negations in otherwise positive relationships can cause serious problems for inference.

Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string
