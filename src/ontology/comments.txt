comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to a class of gene products and a biological process rather than a molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents gene products.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes a substrate-specific process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes a gene product and it contains component information.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is defined as a function term and is in the process ontology.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a grouping term that is not useful, but has caused true path violations.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the transient assembly is better captured as a protein-protein association, if at all.
comment: This term has been obsoleted because it represents a substep of the parent (GO:0006606 protein import into nucleus), has been incorrectly used.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it has been superseded by more accurate terms to represent the biological processes occurring, and it is not clear that this term represents a useful entity.
comment: This term was made obsolete because terms already exist for centrosome/spindle organization which would be more suitable for the existing annotations, and the phase could be captured as an annotation extension if necessary.
comment: This term should not be used in direct manual annotation as it should always be possible to minimally designate mitotic or meiotic checkpoint, and usually to additionally specify the checkpoint (i.e mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, mitotic DNA damage checkpoint etc). Note also that the effector processes are not part of the checkpoint but are positively regulated by the checkpoint signaling and should not be annotated here.
comment: The reason this term was made obsolete is that the two terms cytokinesis checkpoint (GO:0031565) and cytokinesis after mitosis (GO:0000078) were conflated in meaning.
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: This term was made obsolete because it was not defined and the string name implied two separate processes.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'repairosome' has fallen out of use in the literature, and the large complex described in the definition has not been confirmed to exist. The term has also confused annotators.

comment: Note that this term represents a location, not a function; the activity possessed by this complex is mentioned in the definition for the purpose of describing and distinguishing the complex. The function of this complex is represented by the molecular function term 'histone deacetylase activity ; GO:0004407'.

comment: The word floc derives from the Latin word floccus, which means a tuft of wool.
comment: Note that this term represents activities that do not break or form phosphodiester bonds, and is therefore not a parent of 'site-specific recombinase activity ; GO:0009009'.
comment: The term 'RNA editing' (GO:0016547) was merged into 'RNA modification' (GO:0009451) on the basis of statements in the preface of Modification and Editing of RNA (ISBN:1555811337) that there is no clear distinction between modification and editing. Parallel changes were made for substrate (e.g. tRNA, rRNA, etc.) specific child terms of 'RNA editing'.
comment: MAPK cascades lie downstream of many cell surface receptors and cooperate in transmitting various extracellular signals to the nucleus. One way by which the specificity of each cascade is regulated is through the existence of several distinct components in each tier of the different cascades. The cascades are typically named according to the component in the MAPK tier.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a gene product specific term.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'exosome' used in the context of vesicles released from multivesicular bodies.
comment: This term was made obsolete because more specific children exist.

comment: Note that this step represents the formation of the A2-2 complex (yeast) or the C1 complex (mammalian).
comment: Note that this step represents formation of the A2-3 complex (yeast) or the C2 complex (mammalian).
comment: Note that this step is analogous to 5' splice site selection in cis-splicing.
comment: Note that this step represents formation of the A2-1 complex (yeast) or the B1 complex (mammals).
comment: This term was made obsolete because the activities used in the U2- and U12-type complexes are the same. The cellular component ontology should (and does) represent the two different complexes, but the molecular function ontology should not.

comment: Note that Group I introns are known to be found in a number of places: rRNA, mRNA, and tRNA in organelles of fungi, plants, and protists; tRNA and mRNA of bacteria and bacteriophage; rRNA of protists and fungi; and occasionally in mRNA of animal mitochondria (e.g. sea anemone).
comment: Note that Group II introns are known to be found in a number of places: rRNA, mRNA, and tRNA in organelles of fungi, plants, and protists; and mRNA of bacteria.
comment: Note that Group III introns are known to be found in mRNA of plastids of euglenoid protists.
comment: Note that nuclear mRNA, Group I, Group II, and Group III introns are all spliced by a series of two transesterification reactions that occur within the RNA itself, or between two RNAs in trans splicing. Some of these require one or more proteins to stabilize the catalytic conformation, while others are autocatalytic. Note that tRNA introns are spliced by a different catalytic mechanism.
comment: Note that this is not a part of spliceosomal RNA splicing.
comment: Note that this process most commonly occurs in cis, selecting or skipping exons from the same primary transcript, but it has also been observed to occur in trans at low frequency, at least in some mammals.
comment: Note that this step represents formation of the A1 complex (yeast) or the B2 complex (mammalian).
comment: Note that while typically associated with tRNA splicing, this mechanism of splicing is known to be used for some non-tRNA substrates, e.g. HAC1 (YFL031W) in S. cerevisiae and an intron in the 23S rRNA of the Archaeal species Desulfurococcus mobilis.
comment: Note that this step represents formation of the Commitment Complex (CC, in yeast) or the E complex (mammalian).
comment: Note that although the many U12-type introns have the sequence AT-AC at the intron termini, some introns with these terminal sequences are spliced by the U2-type spliceosome. The distinguishing characteristics are sequences near the 5' splice site and the branch point sequences of the intron. Note that although the majority of U2-type introns have the sequence GU-AG at the intron termini, some introns with these terminal sequences are spliced by the U12-type spliceosome. The distinguishing characteristics are sequences near the 5' splice site and the branch point sequences of the intron.
comment: Originally proposed to be involved in transcription as well as promoting telomere uncapping and telomere elongation.
comment: Note that this terms refers to the macroautophagy process and is named by common usage. Be aware that there are a separate micromitophagy and mitophagy by induced vacuole formation processes.
comment: Note that this term is not a child of mitophagy because the community genrally uses that latter to refer to the macroautophagy of mitochondria.
comment: Note that this term is not a child of pexophagy because the community usually uses the latter to refer to the macroautohagy process.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this term can be captured as a GO-CAM model.
comment: Note that with respect to annotation, "base pairing" and its child terms are intended to be used to annotate the activity of gene products composed of nucleic acid, presumably RNA, to interact with DNA molecules via base pairing. Internal base pairing with itself is considered part of the secondary structure of the molecule and is not within the scope of GO function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because there is no ubiquitin in bacteria and they do not have proteasome regulatory particles. Instead they have proteasome-activating nucleotidase.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'GPI-anchor transamidase complex ; GO:0042765', which represents a distinct complex with a different catalytic activity.
comment: Consider also annotating to the molecular function term 'DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase activity ; GO:0003906'.
comment: Note that the repair of pyrimidine dimers by nucleotide excision repair involves the same gene products that are involved in general nucleotide excision repair. Consider also annotating to other children of the biological process term 'nucleotide-excision repair ; GO:0006289'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes a process and not an activity.
comment: This term was obsoleted because its label and definitions were not clear. It had never been used for annotation.
comment: This term was obsoleted because there is no evidence that this process exists.
comment: This term was made obsolete because unidirectional conjugation occurs only in prokaryotes, which do not undergo morphogenetic changes associated with conjugation. In short, the process described by this term does not occur.

comment: Note that this term can be used in place of the obsolete cellular component term 'centromere ; GO:0005698'.
comment: Note that the kinetochore overlaps the centromeric DNA, but centromeric DNA is not part of the kinetochore.
comment: Note that this term can be used in place of the obsolete cellular component term 'centromere ; GO:0005698'. Use with caution because this term refers to a specific region of the chromosome and not a protein complex.
comment: Note that this term can be used in place of the obsolete cellular component term 'telomere ; GO:0005696'. Use with caution because this term refers to a specific region of the chromosome and not a protein complex.

comment: Chromosomes include parts that are not part of the chromatin.  Examples include the kinetochore.
comment: Note that this term can be used to annotate gene products that localize to a mitotic chromosome in an organism that undergoes an 'open mitosis' in which the nuclear envelope breaks down during mitosis.
comment: Note that this term and its children can be used to annotate gene products that localize to a mitotic chromosome in an organism that undergoes a 'closed mitosis' in which the nuclear envelope does not break down during mitosis and for gene products that localize to a meiotic chromosome.
comment: Note that this term and its children should be used to annotate gene products found in cohesin complexes in organisms that undergo closed mitosis (i.e. where the nuclear envelope does not break down, as in fungi). For organisms in which the nuclear envelope breaks down during mitosis, the parent should be used.
comment: In species that have a synaptonemal complex, the lateral elements are part of this complex.  S.pombe is an example of a species that lacks a  (canonical) synaptonemal complex, but still has lateral elements.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is incorrectly defined; 'inositol pyrophosphate' is a inositol derivative to which one (or more) pyrophosphate moieties are attached. 'Inositol pyrophosphate synthase' refers to a class of enzymes that catalyze various different reactions that result in the formation of an IP, so one cannot formulate a general reaction for them.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that biological phases should be captured as extensions.
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. When annotating eukaryotic species, mitotic or meiotic cytokinesis should always be specified for manual annotation and for prokaryotic species use 'FtsZ-dependent cytokinesis ; GO:0043093' or Cdv-dependent cytokinesis ; GO:0061639.  Also, note that cytokinesis does not necessarily result in physical separation and detachment of the two daughter cells from each other.
comment: This term should not be used to describe the last step of cytokinesis in organisms without a cell wall, ie, the cell resealing of the plasma membrane via abscission. Consider annotating to 'GO:0061952 midbody abscission' to capture this process.
comment: To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription.

comment: Note that the definition of basal, or general, transcription factors has typically been done at a small number of well characterized activator-independent promoters. At an activator-dependent promoter, one or more additional factors are generally required in addition to the basal factors.

comment: This term should be used to describe a response to a specific acid as a chemical. E.g., if an organism were responding to glutamate, then the response would be glutamate-specific; the organism is actually responding to the chemical structure of the anion portion of the dissociated acid. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC. If annotating experiments where an acid is playing a role as a proton donor, please annotate to GO:0010447 'response to acidic pH' instead.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it represented a mix of function and process and is not annotated consistently
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this concept is partly covered by other concepts in the ontology and usage has been inconsistent.

comment: Transcription termination sites can be recognized by the RNA polymerase (RNAP) itself or by another protein which interacts with the RNAP to promote transcription termination. Note that not all genes have a specific sequence that functions as a termination site; for most mRNAs transcribed by RNAP II termination is not mediated by a specific termination sequence, but is coupled to polyadenylation.

comment: To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription.

comment: Note that this term should not be used to describe the invasion of host tissues by pathogenic organisms, which is described by the biological process term 'entry into host ; GO:0044409', nor should it be used to describe growth of diseased cells of an organism into the surrounding normal tissue, which is outside of the scope of GO.
comment: This term was made obsolete because more appropriate terms were created.
comment: Note that this term does not have a 'developmental process' parent because ossification isn't necessarily developmental, can also occur as part of bone remodeling. Instead use 'ossification involved in bone maturation ; GO:0043931'.

comment: Note that we deem eukaryotic cilia and microtubule-based flagella to be equivalent, while the bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella have a different structure. The former are microtubule-based structures that lash back and forth and are present only in eukaryotes, while the latter achieve motility by rotation. Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. These three structures never co-exist in the same organism. Therefore, GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term. Direct annotations to GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' may be amended during annotation QC.
comment: This term was made obsolete as part of the metabolism rearrangements, because it is redundant with other terms.

comment: Note that 'antigen displaying cell' in this term encompasses cell types such as follicular dendritic cells which display the unprocessed antigens of a B cell, leading to activation of the B cells and antigen uptake and processing by the B cells.
comment: Note that this term represents the return of immune system cell levels to stable numbers following an immune response as well as the proliferation and elimination of cells of the immune system required to maintain stable numbers in the absence of an outside stimulus.
comment: Note that immunologists typically use the word 'development' to refer to cells of B or T cell lineages undergoing the process that GO describes as 'cell differentiation'.

comment: The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is a central event in the signaling phase of the apoptotic process, and it is often used by researchers to monitor this type of cell death. Any event that induces apoptosis will at some point induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Therefore, this term should only be used to annotate gene products that are directly involved in this process. An example is Drp1 (DNM1L, UniProt symbol O00429) in PMID:20850011.
comment: Note that this term is intended to cover the insertion of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax or its homologs into mitochondrial membranes which occurs as an early step in the apoptotic program.
comment: Note that an opsonin is a blood serum protein or fragment which when deposited on the surface of a bacteria, virus, immune complex, or other particulate material acts a signal for phagocytosis to cells bearing the appropriate receptors. Not all complement components or fragments and not all antibodies have opsonic properties.
comment: Note that the complement cascade includes all of the components involved in the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the lectin complement pathway, as well as the common components of all three pathways.
comment: Note that collectins include such proteins as mannose-binding lectins (MBL) and surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D).

comment: Note that proteins such as mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and certain serum ficolins can activate the lectin complement pathway.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it was an unnecessary grouping term.
comment: defined as response to Saccharomycotina (true yeasts).  This excludes fission yeast.
comment: Note that this term and its children describe contact-dependent killing of target cells by lymphocytes and myeloid cells of the immune system.
comment: Note that either or both mechanisms mentioned in the definition may be used in this process. Note that both granule release and the engagement of death receptors on target cells result in the induction of apoptosis in the target cell. Note that both CD4 and CD8 positive T cells can mediate apoptosis of target cells, independently of their definition as 'helper' T cells or not.

comment: An instance of intramembranous ossification may also be classified as metaplastic; the former classifies based on tissue type location, and the latter based on mechanism/cell division.
comment: Note that this term is not a descendant of 'organelle inner membrane ; GO:0019866' because the outer acrosomal membrane is a portion of the acrosomal membrane; the latter is a single lipid bilayer.

comment: Note that polkadots also contains some amount of MALT1. Interaction with MALT1 is required for formation of the polkadots.
comment: Note that podosomes can be distinguished from other F-actin-rich structures or from other matrix contacts. For example, focal adhesions and focal contacts do not display a core structure of F-actin. Unlike focal adhesions, podosome assembly does not require de novo protein synthesis. However, most of the podosome ring components are found in focal adhesions and other cell-matrix contacts. Podosomes are typically found in cells that cross tissue boundaries, recruited to the leading edge of migrating cells, and are often sites of extracellular matrix degradation.
comment: SOCE is initiated by response to stiumlation of membrane receptors leading to the hydrolysis ofphosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation, and IP3-mediated calcium ion release from the endoplasmic reticulum.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it is outside the scope of GO.
comment: Paternal aggression also exists. Serves to protect the offspring from intruders.
comment: Different forms of the complex differing in type of N-glycosylation of polycystin-1 can exist (endoglycosidase sensitive and endoglycosidase resistant).
comment: Exclusively located at the anticodon wobble position (i.e., position 34) of eubacterial and some organellar tRNAIle2. This modification converts the codon specificity from AUG to AUA, and it also converts the aminoacylation specificity of the tRNA from methionine to isoleucine. Requires ATP.
comment: In E. coli, the first step of the reaction is reductive elimination of sulfur from L-cysteine by IscS cysteine desulfurase to form an enzyme-bound cysteine-persulfide intermediate. Then, five essential gene products, TusA, TusB, TusC, TusD and TusE, mediate a sulfur relay that delivers the terminal sulfur of persulfide from IscS to MnmA12. The last protein, MnmA catalyzes the transfer of the sulfur from IscS to an ATP activated U34 of the tRNA.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that all proteins are imported into the nucleus via the same mechanism, so the import of individual proteins should be captured with extensions or by GO-CAM models.

comment: Note that this reaction is catalyzed by myeloperoxidase in neutrophils.
comment: The structures of RNA and DNA G quartets differ regarding sugar conformation so that a protein binding to the RNA structure might not bind to the DNA structure.
comment: The bile acid is first activated using CoA by cholate-CoA ligase activity(GO:0047747), then conjugated to taurine or glycine by glycine N-choloyltransferase activity (GO:0047963; appears to use either glycine or taurine).
comment: Note: there is also evidence that the RNA itself may code a protein (solution structure of mouse steroid receptor RNA activator 1 (SRA1) protein submitted to PDB by Riken).
comment: Desmosomes link two cells together; hemidesmosomes attach one cell to the extracellular matrix.
comment: Desmosomes link two cells together; hemidesmosomes attach one cell to the extracellular matrix.
comment: This complex occurs primarily in bacteria.
comment: Note that this term applies to translation performed by cytoplasmic ribosomes, which is distinct from translation performed by organellar ribosomes. For mitochondrial translation, consider GO:0032543 'mitochondrial translation' or its child terms.
comment: In mammals, the complex consists of two non-identical catalytic subunits and two non-identical regulatory subunits.
comment: In Salmonella typhimurium, 2-methylthio-N-6-(cis-hydroxy)isopentenyl adenosine (ms2io6A; also referred to as 2-methylthio cis-ribozeatin) is found in tRNA, most likely in the species that have ms2i6A in E. coli.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it does not refer to a real biological process.
comment: Note that this process covers somatic recombination, gene conversion, hypermutation, N-region addition, and alternate splicing processes of immune receptor diversification.
comment: Note that this type of immune receptor may not be limited to insects.
comment: Note that jawless fish refers to both lampreys (Petremyzontidae, ncbi_taxonomy_id:7746) and hagfish (Myxinidae, ncbi_taxonomy_id:7762).
comment: Note that a separate term covers proteolysis by the proteasome complex (proteasomal proteolysis associated with antigen processing and presentation ; GO:0002497).
comment: Note that the vertebrate toll-like receptors, unlike the Drosophila Toll molecule, directly bind their ligands. The Drosophila Toll molecule requires the Sptzle factor to bind microbial ligands and then the receptor in order to initiate innate immune responses.

comment: Archaeosine (7-formamidino-7-deazaguanosine) is a structural variant of the hypermodified nucleoside 7-deazaguanosine. The biosynthesis pathway starts with archaeosine tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (ArcTGT) which catalyzes the exchange of guanine at position 15 in the D-loop of archaeal tRNAs with a free 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine.
comment: Ischemia always results in hypoxia; however, hypoxia can occur without ischemia.
comment: In E. coli, two genes are involved, nuvA (aka Thi) and NuvC (aka iscS) . NuvA converts the trNA into an unidentified intermediate in an ATP dependent manner. NucC catalyzes the second step, transferring the sulfur from cysteine to an unidentified intermediate. NuvC also participates in thiamine synthesis.
comment: Dihydrouridine is found in numerous positions within loop I, the so-called dihydrouridine loop, of many transfer RNAs. Most often found at positions 16 and 17, but also sometimes at positions 20, 20a, and 20b.
comment: The mouse enzyme is specific for leukotriene C(4), while the human enzyme also has considerable activity toward glutathione and oxidized glutathione (cf. EC:3.4.19.13). PMID:9774450 cites that the mouse form of this enzyme failed to measure activity towards glutathione.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes involvement of the nodal signaling pathway in lateral mesoderm left/right asymmetry. Nodal proteins are members of the TGF-beta superfamily, but are distinct from TGF-beta proteins themselves. TGF-beta proteins are not currently known to regulate left/right asymmetry in the lateral mesoderm.

comment: This term was made obsolete because more specific terms were created.
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.
comment: Note that this term was deleted from GO and was restored to the ontology in Feb 2003 to ensure that the ID is not reused.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents two functions.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it includes a process term.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it does not represent a true molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to component information.
comment: This term was obsoleted because the definition was not clear enough as to what is directing specificity of the binding to the DNA.
comment: Note that this term is restricted to those cases where the binding is to a single-stranded DNA molecule, not to one of the stands of double-stranded DNA.
comment: Usage guidance: Most DNA-binding transcription factors do not have enzymatic activity. The presence of specific DNA-binding domains known to be present in DNA-binding transcription factors (HOX, GATA etc) should be used to help decide whether a protein is a DNA binding transcription factor or a coregulator. If a protein has an enzymatic activity (for example, ubiquitin ligase, histone acetyl transferase) and no known DNA binding domain, consider annotating to GO:0003712 transcription coregulator activity. Special care should be taken with proteins containing zinc fingers, Myb/SANT and ARID domains, since only a subset of proteins containing these domains directly and selectively bind to regulatory DNA motifs in cis-regulatory regions.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.

comment: This term was obsoleted because "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription vs "specific" transcription were determined not to be separable, distinct process. Thus, terms trying to distinguish "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription from "specific" transcription were removed from both the Molecular Function and the Biological Process ontologies. In addition, this Molecular Function term was defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism.

comment: Note that this function was formerly EC:1.13.11.21.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it does not correspond to a physiological reaction.\nUsage comment: The gene family commonly referred to as gamma-glutamyl transferases (GGT) catalyze hydrolysis of gamma-glutamyl bonds in gamma-glutamyl compounds such as glutathione. In a test tube one can set up conditions in which the enzyme will transfer the gamma-glutamyl portion of the substrate to an acceptor molecule, but this requires non-physiologic conditions, including millmolar concentrations of an acceptor such as glygly. This reaction is used in assays to detect the presence of the enzyme, but is not a physiological function of members of the GGT family (PMC4388159), which should be annotated to a suitable hydrolysis term instead (e.g. glutathione hydrolase activity).

comment: Note that the term 'histone lysine acetyltransferase activity ; GO:0046971' was merged into this term because only lysine residues are ever acetylated in histones, and so the term was redundant.
comment: Note that this function was formerly EC:4.1.3.21.
comment: Note that this function was formerly EC:4.3.1.8.
comment: Note that this function was formerly EC:4.1.3.5.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a grouping term representing two quite different sets of entities, hexose sugars and glycerophospholipids.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is not a valid molecular function.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a grouping term representing two quite different sets of entities, hexose sugars and glycerophospholipids.
comment: Note that this function includes EC:3.1.3.65.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the existence of this function has not been established.
comment: Note that this is a compound function and should be replaced by 'GO:0052659 : inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity' and 'GO:0052658 : inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity'.
comment: Note that this function was EC:2.5.1.37.
comment: For decarboxylation of oxaloacetate (the second substrate listed in EC:1.1.1.38), see 'oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity ; GO:0008948'.

comment: Note that this function was formerly EC:4.1.3.2.
comment: In mammals, L-DOPA can act as a cofactor for the catalyzed reaction; therefore in some resources L-DOPA is shown on both sides of the reaction. GO:0004503 describes the monooxygenation of the monophenol, L-tyrosine. For oxidation of diphenols (including L-DOPA and dopamine), consider instead the term 'catechol oxidase activity ; GO:0004097' and its children.
comment: Note that 'tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity ; GO:0009022', also known as 'ribonuclease PH', and 'DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase activity ; GO:0003906' do not have parentage in the 'nuclease activity' branch of the ontology because both GO and the Enzyme Commission define nuclease activity as a type of hydrolysis.
comment: Note that the EC recommended name for this enzyme activity is 'calf thymus ribonuclease H', even though it is found in many species.
comment: Note that the inclusion of 'MetaCyc:BGALACT-PWY' is exceptional: normally MetaCyc pathway entries are database references for biological process terms, not molecular function terms. An exception was made in this case because the MetaCyc entry 'BGALACT-PWY' describes only one reaction, that catalyzed by beta-galactosidase.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this activity has been replaced by 4 activities in EC, EC:2.4.1.258, EC:2.4.1.259, EC:2.4.1.260, and EC:2.4.1.261.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product, and because the gene was named after its location of action rather than after its molecular function.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it was not clearly defined.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'pseudouridine synthase activity ; GO:0009982', which refers to the intramolecular isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine.
comment: When thioredoxin is substituted for glutaredoxin in the reaction, annotate instead to 'ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase, glutaredoxin disulfide as acceptor ; GO:0036175'.
comment: Note that this function was formerly EC:1.14.99.5.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the function is covered by an existing term.
comment: Note that this function was formerly EC:4.2.1.16.
comment: Note that this was EC:3.8.1.4.
comment: Note that the bond resulting from this reaction is a carboxylic acid ester bond, linking the alpha carboxyl group of the amino acid to either the 2' or 3' hydroxyl of the 3'- terminal adenyl residue of the tRNA.
comment: The ubiquitin activating enzyme catalyzes a ligation reaction.
comment: Take care to annotate to the reaction, not simply the enzyme name. The name "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" has variously been used to refer to two distinctly different enzymes. Both enzymes act on ureidoglycolate and produce glyoxylate, but the mechanism and reaction products are different. The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" listed in the Enzyme commission (EC) is a ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase, releasing ammonia, (EC:3.5.3.19, GO:0004848). The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" characterized in PMID:3915539 (published prior to the EC designation of EC:3.5.3.19) is a ureidoglycolate lyase, releasing urea (EC:4.3.2.3, GO:0050385). The inappropriate labelling of ureidoglycolate lyase as EC:3.5.3.19 has caused much confusion in the literature (see PMID:24107613). Take care to correctly annotate based on the reaction products, rather than name.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a class of gene products.

comment: This term was obsoleted because it represents a gene product.
comment: Note that the complement cascade includes all of the components involved in the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the lectin complement pathway, as well as the common components of all three pathways.
comment: Usage guidance: Nuclear receptors are a protein family defined by the presence of a C4-type zinc finger DNA-binding domain and a ligand binding domain. For nuclear receptors, the DNA binding motif is most often referred to as a response element. GO:0004879 is intended for annotation of nuclear receptors that regulate transcription by binding directly to DNA. When the nuclear receptor functions by binding to other transcription factors or transcription factor complexes, consider instead annotating to 'GO:0030374 ; nuclear receptor transcription coactivator activity' or GO:0140536 ; nuclear corepressor activity.
comment: This term includes intracellular membrane receptors, e.g. IP3 triggered release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.

comment: Note that many gene products that are called scavenger receptors have a broad range of potential ligands and also can be annotated to 'pattern recognition receptor activity ; GO:0038187' or its child terms, or to 'lipoprotein receptor activity ; GO:0030228' or its child terms. For receptors that transduce a signal rather than endocytose their ligand, consider instead the terms 'signaling receptor activity ; GO:0038023' and its children.

comment: Note that guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity alters binding affinity, but not GTPase catalytic activity directly. Therefore GO:0005085 is under 'regulation of GTPase activity' but is not a 'GTPase regulator', which is reserved for cases where the action of one gene product directly alters the rate of catalysis by another gene product.

comment: Some transporters, such as certain members of the SLC family, are referred to as 'carriers'; however GO uses carrier with a different meaning: a carrier binds to and transports the substance (see GO:0140104 molecular carrier activity), whereas a transporter forms some pore that allows the passing of molecules.

comment: This term was made obsolete because its meaning was ambiguous, it was undefined and its position in the tree wrong.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it contains both component and function information.
comment: The term was obsoleted because its intended usage was unclear: chromaffin granules are dense core secretory vesicles (PMID:20853344) so whatever they transport must be by secretion.

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the cellular component ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose cellular component is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the cellular component of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.
comment: Note that this term is intended to annotate gene products that are not attached to the cell surface. For gene products from multicellular organisms which are secreted from a cell but retained within the organism (i.e. released into the interstitial fluid or blood), consider the cellular component term 'extracellular space ; GO:0005615'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a single gene product and not a complex.
comment: The acronym FACIT stands for fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helix.
comment: Collagen X trimers have been observed to form hexagonal lattices in vitro, but in vivo they have been found in a fibril associated form (PMID:19693541).
comment: This term was made obsolete because prior to cleavage, complement component C2 is a single polypeptide rather than a complex, and after cleavage the products do not remain physically associated; there is thus no known biological entity corresponding to "complement C2 complex".
comment: Note that this term has no relationship to 'membrane ; GO:0016020' because the basement membrane is not a lipid bilayer.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is out of date. It seems to be referring to the non-integrin 34/67kDa laminin receptor, which new research has shown to actually be a ribosomal protein of the SP2 family.
comment: Note that for multicellular organisms, the extracellular space refers to everything outside a cell, but still within the organism (excluding the extracellular matrix). Gene products from a multi-cellular organism that are secreted from a cell into the interstitial fluid or blood can therefore be annotated to this term.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it was redundant with the root class of the cell ontology, CL:0000000.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to two distinct complexes, PCNA and Replication factor C (RFC), the latter of which is already represented as a separate, unrelated GO term (DNA replication factor C complex ; GO:0005663). In addition, the phrase 'delta-DNA polymerase cofactor' to represent both PCNA and RFC is not used in current literature.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a single gene product and not a complex.
comment: In human, this complex is composed of GCN5 or PCAF, ADA2a, ADA3, ZZZ3, ATAC2, SGF29, HCF1, WDR5,YEATS2, NC2-beta, and MBIP.
comment: This term was made obsolete because its definition no longer reflects and cannot be modified to be consistent with the current state of knowledge.
comment: Note that the synonym 'APC' should not be confused with the abbreviation for the adenomatous polyposis coli gene and protein.
comment: A U2-type complex refers to any of the snRNP-based complexes that form during splicing that uses U2 (as opposed to U12). There are complexes that form during U2-splicing that don't necessarily contain the U2 snRNP.
comment: U2 snRNP refers to the U2 small nuclear RNA and the proteins that associate with it. U2 snRNP is not considered to be a type of spliceosomal complex by itself.
comment: Chromosomes include parts that are not part of the chromatin.  Examples include the kinetochore.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is not a unique subcellular component, i.e. the difference between this term and 'chromosome' is based on temporal and process distinctions.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the definition was too sequence oriented and too restrictive.

comment: This term was obsoleted because there is no heterochromatin at the telomere and the term had been used inconsistently.
comment: Note that 'nucleolar' in the name acronym 'snoRNA' is part of the RNA family designation 'small nucleolar', and does not reflect the location of the complex. Both box C/D type and box H/ACA RNAs are found in Archaea (where they are referred to as sRNAs) as well as in Eukaryota. In eukaryotes, box H/ACA RNAs are found in both nucleolar-localized snoRNP complexes and in Cajal body-localized scaRNP complexes.

comment: Some anaerobic or microaerophilic organisms (e.g. Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis and several Microsporidia species) do not have mitochondria, and contain mitochondrion-related organelles (MROs) instead, called mitosomes or hydrogenosomes, very likely derived from mitochondria. To annotate gene products located in these mitochondrial relics in species such as Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis or others, please use GO:0032047 'mitosome' or GO:0042566 'hydrogenosome'. (See PMID:24316280 for a list of species currently known to contain mitochondrion-related organelles.)
comment: See also the cellular component term 'mitochondrial inner membrane ; GO:0005743'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because more specific terms were created.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a single polypeptide rather than a complex; all known peroxisome targeting signal receptors are monomeric.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to a cell fractionation experimental result and not a bona fide cellular component.
comment: Note that the Golgi apparatus can be located in various places in the cytoplasm. In plants and lower animal cells, the Golgi apparatus exists as many copies of discrete stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, while the Golgi apparatus of interphase mammalian cells is a juxtanuclear, often pericentriolar reticulum, where the discrete Golgi stacks are stitched together to form a compact and interconnected ribbon, sometimes called the Golgi ribbon.
comment: Note that this definition includes vesicles that are transiently associated with the Golgi.
comment: This term was made obsolete because its position and synonym implied that it confused a coated vesicle with the coat itself.
comment: This term was made obsolete as part of a general reorganization of vesicle and vesicle coat terms; its position in the ontology suggested that a new term was required.
comment: The CGN is not considered part of the Golgi apparatus but is a separate organelle.
comment: There are different opinions about whether the TGN should be considered part of the Golgi apparatus or not.  We follow Alberts et al, 1994 (ISBN:0815316194), who consider it to be a part.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was being used to describe two different components.
comment: This term was made obsolete because its parent was made obsolete.
comment: This term was made obsolete as part of a general reorganization of vesicle and vesicle coat terms; its position in the ontology suggested that a new term was required.

comment: This term was made obsolete as part of a general reorganization of vesicle and vesicle coat terms; a personal communication from John Armstrong indicated that a replacement term was not required, as TGN-Golgi transport is likely to be mediated by tubules rather than vesicles.

comment: Note that this term does not refer to vesicles, but instead to structures in which lipids do not necessarily form bilayers.
comment: In most eukaryotic cells, 'ciliary basal body' (GO:0036064) and 'centriole' (GO:0005814) represent a common entity that cycles through its function in cell division, then ciliogenesis, then cell division again. However, these structures are modified extensively as they transition into each other, and may contain different proteins, specific to each component.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was not defined.
comment: See also the molecular function term 'G protein-coupled receptor activity ; GO:0004930'.
comment: Note that fatty acid synthetases of vertebrates and yeast are stable enzyme complexes of multifunctional polypeptide chains, whereas the fatty acid synthetases of plants and E. coli consist of non-associated individual enzymes.
comment: This term was made obsolete because its definition was inaccurate.
comment: Note that this complex can be found in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus.
comment: Note that this term is labelled based on phylogenetic classification and community usage, rather than strict cellular localization. Cytoplasmic dynein complexes may contain ciliary dyneins; therefore the term is not linked to 'cytoplasm'. Cytoplasmic dynein complexes do not contain axonemal dyneins; see GO:0005858 axonemal dynein complex.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes the composition (i.e. proteoglycan) and not the location of a gene product.
comment: Note that this term refers to a projection from a single cell, and should not be confused with 'microvillus' as used to refer to a multicellular structure such as that found in the placenta.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was positioned incorrectly, so the replacement term has a definition different from what this term appeared to mean.
comment: This term was made obsolete as part of a general reorganization of vesicle and vesicle coat terms; its position in the ontology was erroneous.
comment: This term was made obsolete as part of a general reorganization of vesicle and vesicle coat terms; its position in the ontology was erroneous.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that, based on the most recent literature, there is no such structure in biology as 'cell-substrate adherens junction'. An 'adherens junction' is always a 'cell-cell junction' (PMIDs: 20571587, 17854762, 21422226, 28096264, 28401269, 26923917).
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this term has not been used for GO annotation at all since 2001 when it was created, it has no children, it is not a part of any subset/slim.
comment: Note that we deem cilium and microtubule-based flagellum to be equivalent. In most eukaryotic species, intracellular sub-components of the cilium, such as the ciliary base and rootlet, are located near the plasma membrane. In Diplomonads such as Giardia, instead, the same ciliary parts are located further intracellularly. Also, 'cilium' may be used when axonemal structure and/or motility are unknown, or when axonemal structure is unusual. For all other cases, please refer to children of 'cilium'. Finally, note that any role of ciliary proteins in sensory events should be captured by annotating to relevant biological process terms.
comment: Note that cilia and eukaryotic flagella are deemed to be equivalent. In diplomonad species, such as Giardia, the axoneme may extend intracellularly up to 5um away from the plane of the plasma membrane.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a type of whole cell rather than a cellular component. To update annotations, consider the external ontology term 'shmoo ; FAO:0001023'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was originally intended only as a temporary parent for protein complex terms for which no more specific parents had been found. This term no longer has any children: All protein complex terms are is_a 'protein complex ; GO:0043234' and nearly all have been placed under parents to yield more specific paths traversing a part_of relationship. In other words, the term has been superseded by other terms and relationships in the cellular component ontology, and is no longer needed.

comment: See also the molecular function term 'alpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase (UDP-forming) activity ; GO:0003825'.
comment: See also the molecular function term 'acetolactate synthase activity ; GO:0003984'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the catalytic activity resides in a single polypeptide that is not part of a complex with other gene products.
comment: Note that in higher eukaryotes, carbamoyl-phosphate synthase is usually a single polypeptide, not a complex, and should therefore not be annotated to this component term.
comment: Note that this term represents a location and not a function; the activity possessed by this complex is mentioned in the definition for the purpose of describing and distinguishing the complex.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is ambiguous (there are several debranching enzymes) and because it probably represents the glycogen debranching enzyme which is a single gene product and not a complex.
comment: Note that this term represents a location and not a function; the activity possessed by this complex is mentioned in the definition for the purpose of describing and distinguishing the complex. The function of this complex is represented by the molecular function term 'isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+) activity ; GO:0004449'.
comment: Note that this term represents a location and not a function; the activity possessed by this complex is mentioned in the definition for the purpose of describing and distinguishing the complex. The functions of this complex are represented by the molecular function terms 'pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) activity ; GO:0004739', 'dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase activity ; GO:0004742', and 'dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase activity ; GO:0004148'.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes a molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is not clear what it is intended to represent.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was an unnecessary grouping term.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the term string represents a molecular function and not a biological pathway.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function rather than a biological process.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function rather than a biological process.
comment: The reason for making this term obsolete is that it gets misused in cases where phosphates are simply being removed from a small molecule. We found no cases where these molecules genuinely underwent catabolism.

comment: DNA biosynthesis is only part of this process. See also the biological process terms 'DNA-dependent DNA replication ; GO:0006261' and 'RNA-dependent DNA replication ; GO:0006278'.
comment: Note that the synonym 'DNA underwinding' should not be confused with 'DNA unwinding ; GO:0006268', which refers to DNA strand separation, and is a type of geometric change. GO:0006265 refers to alteration of the superhelical density of double-stranded DNA. Note that DNA topological change and DNA geometric change (GO:0032392) are distinct, but are usually coupled in vivo.
comment: Note that this term refers to a geometric change in DNA conformation, and should not be confused with 'DNA topological change ; GO:0006265'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because mutagenesis is not a valid biological process in which gene products would normally participate. Rather, mutations arise from DNA replication errors or damage by an extrinsic agent.
comment: Note that although intrastrand cross-link repair is not exactly synonymous with nucleotide excision repair, nucleotide excision repair includes the repair of intrastrand cross-links. The synonym field is being used to reflect the broad substrate specificity of nucleotide excision repair.
comment: This term was made obsolete because this process can be subdivided into multiple processes.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a substrate specific DNA repair process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'short patch' is a relative statement, often used ambiguously, and does not necessarily represent a process; the processes it can stand for are base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, and mismatch repair.
comment: Note that the processes of nuclear double-strand break repair and mitochondrial double-strand break repair are genetically separable (PMID:22214610). To annotate gene products involved in mitochondrial double-strand break repair, please use GO:0097551 'mitochondrial double-strand break repair'.
comment: DNA fragmentation in response to apoptotic signals is achieved through the activity of apoptotic nucleases. In human, these include DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) or caspase-activated DNase (CAD) and endonuclease G (Endo G) (reviewed in PMID:15723341). Caution is needed when apoptotic DNA laddering assays show presence of fragmented DNA. A positive assay may simply reflect the end point of a whole apoptotic process. Unless clear experimental evidence is available to show that a gene product is directly involved in fragmenting DNA, please do not annotate to GO:0006309 'apoptotic DNA fragmentation' and consider annotating instead to a more upstream process such as, e.g., GO:0042981 'regulation of apoptotic process', GO:0006915 'apoptotic process', GO:0097190 'apoptotic signaling pathway'. Also, note that gene products involved in compartmentalization of apoptotic nucleases and in activation or repression of their enzymatic activity should be annotated to the regulation term GO:1902510 'regulation of apoptotic DNA fragmentation' or to one of its children (see PMID:15723341).
comment: This term was made obsolete because histone modification already exists and the phase specificity is better captured as an annotation extension.

comment: Note that this process is the opposite of chromatin-mediated maintenance of transcription. This regulation is exemplified by members of the Polycomb group, which maintain the inactive state of homeotic gene transcription.
comment: Note that promoter clearance is represented as a separate step, not part_of either initiation or elongation.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents several different processes.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it does not represent a process unique to splicing of the MATa1 (A1) pre-mRNA, but a recycling defect exacerbated by the presence of two introns within the same gene.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function and not a biological process.
comment: Note that promoter clearance is represented as a separate step, not part_of either initiation or elongation.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it has been replaced with a more specific term to describe cap hypermethylation. All RNA polymerase II transcripts receive a 7-methyl-G cap. Then for (at least) small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), the 7-methyl-G cap is hypermethylated to become a 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap.
comment: Note that while typically associated with tRNA splicing, splicing via endonucleolytic cleavages and subsequent ligation of the free exon ends is known to be used for some non-tRNA substrates, e.g. HAC1 (YFL031W) in S. cerevisiae and an intron in the 23S rRNA of the Archaeal species Desulfurococcus mobilis.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it does not represent a process unique to splicing of the tyrosyl (Y) tRNA.
comment: The term 'RNA editing' (GO:0016547) was merged into 'RNA modification' (GO:0009451) on the basis of statements in the preface of Modification and Editing of RNA (ISBN:1555811337) that there is no clear distinction between modification and editing. Parallel changes were made for substrate (e.g. tRNA, rRNA, etc.) specific child terms of 'RNA editing'.
comment: This term was obsoleted because the name and the definition mean two completely different things: 1) "transcription, RNA-dependent", i.e. RNA-dependent production of an RNA transcript and 2) "reverse transcription", i.e. RNA-dependent DNA synthesis.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a function rather than a process.

comment: This term was made obsolete because the string was ambiguous and the original meaning of the term was hence unknown.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it presents a molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a redundant grouping term.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a single activity.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the term name is ambiguous.
comment: This term was made obsolete because there is no evidence for the existence of this process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the term name is ambiguous.
comment: For non-covalent interactions with a lipid, consider instead the term 'lipid binding ; GO:0008289' and its children.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the process is not exclusive to the carboxy-terminus of a protein.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the process is not exclusive to the carboxy-terminus of a protein.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the process is not exclusive to the carboxy-terminus of a protein.
comment: This term was intentionally placed under 'protein metabolic process ; GO:0019538' rather than 'protein catabolic process ; GO:0030163' to cover all processes centered on breaking peptide bonds, including those involved in protein processing.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it implies that every protein that is ubiquitinated is also subsequently deubiquinitated, which is not true. Also, the process ontology does not include analogous terms for other small modifiers.
comment: Note that the third step in this pathway (conversion of succinate semialdehyde to succinate) can be catalyzed by NAD-dependent or NADP-dependent succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC:1.2.1.24 and EC:1.2.1.79, respectively).
comment: Note that this term does not fall under the general GO definition for biosynthetic processes, which is 'The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of... ', because thyroid hormones can only be formed by the proteolysis of a larger molecule (see term definition). The word 'generation' is therefore used in place of biosynthesis.
comment: Note that protein targeting encompasses the transport of the protein to the specified location, and may also include additional steps such as protein processing.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that all proteins are imported into the nucleus via the same mechanism, so the import of individual proteins should be captured with extensions or by GO-CAM models.

comment: Ribosomal protein rpl12 uses a different import pathway, which is why it has a separate GO term.
comment: This term was made obsolete because there is no evidence for the existence of this process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because its definition was equivalent to that of the biological process term 'mitochondrial matrix protein import ; GO:0030150' while the mitochondrial translocation has a broader meaning; this led to mis-annotation.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function and not a biological process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was created to cover the conversion of ecdysone to its active form ecdysterone (20-hydroxyecdysone), but this reaction is carried out in a single step by ecdysone 20-monooxygenase (EC:1.14.99.22) and so is a function rather than a process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function and not a biological process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was replaced by more specific terms.
comment: 1. Making inferences in GO about compounds based on the coenzyme role curated by ChEBI creates relationships that are not always true which violates ontological principles for GO; therefore we will cease making these inferences. 2. It is not meaningful to group metabolic processes that are not all metabolically related by the fact that they may be used as a coenzyme.

comment: This term was made obsolete because, according to PUMA2, this "pathway" is a single reaction, corresponding to 'carbamate kinase activity ; GO:0008804' (EC:2.7.2.2).
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function rather than a biological process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function rather than a biological process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because, as part of the GO/ChEBI alignment effort, curators determined that oxygen and reactive oxygen species should not be grouped together.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function and not a biological process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'resistance' implies a phenotype rather than a biological process.
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. It should be possible to make a more specific annotation to one of the children of this term, for e.g. to transmembrane transport, to microtubule-based transport or to vesicle-mediated transport.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a composite term that represents two individual processes.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'heavy metal' is an ambiguous grouping term which has no set meaning (see Pure Appl. Chem. Vol. 74, No. 5, pp. 793-807, 2002, for more information).

comment: See also the cellular component term 'mitochondrial inner membrane ; GO:0005743'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function and not a biological process.
comment: Note that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the term name is ambiguous and as a result, the term was incorrectly placed in the ontology (it was a descendant of 'protein transport').
comment: This term was made obsolete because it mixes two processes that can be better captured in separate terms.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the meaning of the term is ambiguous.
comment: Note that cell surface molecules involved in the direct binding of bacteria may be also annotated to the molecular function term 'bacterial cell surface binding ; GO:0051635'. Note that cell surface molecules involved in the direct binding to opsonins such as complement components or antibodies may be also annotated to the term 'opsonin binding ; GO:0001846'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because of the ambiguity in its meaning.
comment: Note that transport through the nuclear pore complex is not transmembrane because the nuclear membrane is a double membrane, and is not traversed.
comment: This term was made obsolete because more accurate terms were created.
comment: This term should be used when the annotation refers to a process that occurs in a context of apoptotic cell death. To annotate gene products involved in activation of cysteine-type endopeptidases in other cellular process (e.g., cell cycle arrest) that do not necessarily develop into an apoptotic process, please use the more general parent term GO:0097202. Examples of 'activation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process' are cytochrome c and Apaf1. When cytochrome c is released from mitochondria and forms a complex with Apaf1, they form a scaffolding platform in which the pro-caspase 9 is bound (the 'apoptosome'). The caspase is then cleaved and activated. Cytochrome c and Apaf1 are therefore involved in the conversion of the zymogen procaspase 9 to the active form of the caspase.
comment: This term was made obsolete because more accurate terms were created.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it refers to targets of effector proteins (caspases); the 'cleavage' process referred to in the term name is in fact the same molecular function represented by GO:0097200 'cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in execution phase of apoptosis'.

comment: This term was made obsolete because the meaning of the term is ambiguous, as it's possibly conflating at least two scenarios: 1) the organism apoptoses its own cell because it detects it is infected with a virus; 2) the virus induces apoptosis so the cell is lysed and the virus disseminated. Please consider using viral process terms to annotate viral proteins. As for the cellular apoptotic process, this likely occurs via the same mechanisms described by existing apoptotic process terms, so please consider using those to annotate cellular proteins.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it does not refer to a normal process.
comment: Note that in GO cellular components include whole cells (cell is_a cellular component).
comment: This term was made obsolete because its meaning is vague, and it does not fit with other terms in GO.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is redundant outside the context of Saccharomyces biology.
comment: Where syncytium formation results in the spread of virus in the host, also consider annotating to the term 'spread of virus in multicellular host ; GO:0046739'.
comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was undefined and represented an abnormal process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was too specific with respect to a single gene product.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'unfolded protein response ; GO:0030968', which refers to one specific response to the presence of unfolded proteins in the ER.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this process represents a single step (molecular function) of the IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response (GO:0036498).

comment: This term was obsoleted because it represents a molecular function.
comment: See also the biological process term 'endocytosis ; GO:0006897'.
comment: The primary label for merged term was 'cell-substrate adherens junction assembly' GO:0007045. The term was merged into the parent 'cell-substrate junction assembly', because, based on the most recent litarature, 'adherens junction' is always a 'cell-cell junction' (PMID:20571587, PMID:17854762, PMID:21422226, PMID:28096264, PMID:28401269, PMID:26923917).

comment: This term was made obsolete because the term name is ambiguous and appears to encompass two processes.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete as part of the cell cycle overhaul. This is because it was decided that cell cycle phases are intervals and so cannot be regulated, rather it is the transitions between the phases that are regulated.
comment: false
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was not defined.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it was vaguely defined and had very likely been used in error. Consider the child terms of cytokinesis related to ring positioning, assembly, ring constriction etc. which would be more appropriate.

comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'abortive mitotic cell cycle ; GO:0033277'. Although abortive mitosis is sometimes called endomitosis, GO:0033277 refers to a process in which a mitotic spindle forms and chromosome separation begins.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents two processes.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a phenotype rather than a biological process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a phenotype rather than a biological process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it has been split into two new terms.
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: Note that female germ lines can be found in female or hermaphroditic organisms, so this term can be used to annotate gene products from hermaphrodites such as those of C. elegans. See also the biological process term 'meiotic nuclear division; GO:0140013'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes a phenotype rather than a biological goal.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the original meaning of the term is unclear, the current definition is incorrect, and it does not describe a biological process.
comment: Note that signal transduction is defined broadly to include a ligand interacting with a receptor, downstream signaling steps and a response being triggered. A change in form of the signal in every step is not necessary. Note that in many cases the end of this process is regulation of the initiation of transcription. Note that specific transcription factors may be annotated to this term, but core/general transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase should not.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a function rather than a process.
comment: This term describes the breakdown of epidermal growth factor within the cell, following internalization. For proteolysis events that result in the maturation of an epidermal growth factor receptor ligand, see 'epidermal growth factor receptor ligand maturation ; GO:'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a function.
comment: This term is intended to cover steps in a GPCR signaling pathway both upstream and downstream of adenylate-cyclase activity. For steps upstream of adenylate cyclase activity, consider instead annotating to 'regulation of adenylate cyclase activity involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway ; GO:0010578.

comment: This term is intended to cover steps in a GPCR signaling pathway both upstream and downstream of phospholipase C (PLC) activity.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the dissociation of heterotrimeric G protein subunits is a consequence of a conformational change, which is in turn a consequence of ligand binding; it does not require multiple activities specifically to bring about.
comment: Note that this term refers to a signaling pathway, and should not be confused with function terms such as 'phospholipase activator activity ; GO:0016004'.

comment: 1. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation reviews.\n2. While a broader definition of behavior encompassing plants and single cell organisms would be justified on the basis of some usage (see PMID:20160973 for discussion), GO uses a tight definition that limits behavior to animals and to responses involving the nervous system, excluding plant responses that GO classifies under development, and responses of unicellular organisms that has general classifications for covering the responses of cells in multicellular organisms (e.g. cell chemotaxis).
comment: This term was made obsolete because there is no clear difference between the sensu Insecta term and the generic term.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the function is covered by a parent term.
comment: This term was made obsolete because its name is ambiguous, and it was never defined.
comment: This term should not be confused with GO:0097547 'synaptic vesicle protein transport vesicle'. STVs and synaptic vesicles differ both functionally and morphologically. Functionally, STVs are transport vesicles that deliver synaptic vesicle proteins to synapses, while synaptic vesicles are responsible for transmitter release at synapses. Morphologically, synaptic vesicles are very homogeneous, while STVs are very heterogeneous in size and shape. STVs might be a precursor for synaptic vesicles.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product and not a molecular function.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to two different functions, a glutamine amidotransferase that functions as an aminodeoxychorismate synthase [itself composed of two enzymatic activities, a glutaminase and a chorismate aminase (this latter is sometimes referred to as the aminodeoxychorismate synthase)] and a 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate aromatase (4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase). Note that the name 'para-amino benzoate synthase' was initially given to the 'aminodeoxychorismate synthase' activity before the additional lyase activity was discovered.
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.
comment: Note that metabolic processes do not include single functions or processes such as protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acids, nor receptor-ligand interactions.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents involvement in a biological process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it does not represent a molecular function.
comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation. The only exception should be when experimental data (e.g., staining with trypan blue or propidium iodide) show that cell death has occurred, but fail to provide details on death modality (accidental versus programmed). When information is provided on the cell death mechanism, annotations should be made to the appropriate descendant of 'cell death' (such as, but not limited to, GO:0097300 'programmed necrotic cell death' or GO:0006915 'apoptotic process'). Also, if experimental data suggest that a gene product influences cell death indirectly, rather than being involved in the death process directly, consider annotating to a 'regulation' term.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the term has been used in the literature by groups in different areas of biology with a number of varying explicit and implicit definitions, and more appropriate terms were created.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product, and because describing something as an 'antigen' means that an organism can produce antibodies to it, which says nothing about the gene product activity.

comment: Note that this term represents an activity and not a gene product. Consider also annotating to the molecular function term 'potassium channel activity ; GO:0005267'.
comment: This term was moved out from being a child of 'cellular process' because it is a cell population-level process, and cellular processes are restricted to those processes that involve individual cells.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: Gene products that may be annotated to this term include: 1) ligands such as FASL; 2) receptors such as FAS/CD95 (though care should be taken because FAS can also act as a non-apoptotic signal transducer); 3) signaling molecules such as FADD (FAS-associated protein with a death domain), cIAPs (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins), c-FLIPs and caspases 8 and 10. Examples are TWEAK (TNF12) and FN14 (TNFRSF12A) (UniProt symbols O43508 and Q9NP84) in PMID:21525013.
comment: This term is placed under GO:0097190 apoptotic signaling pathway, rather than under one of its more specific children terms, to cover for the variety of apoptosis signaling mechanisms that different hormones may use.
comment: This term was made obsolete because more specific terms were created. Additionally, the meaning of the term is ambiguous (some gene products may be involved in apoptosis, or not, depending on cell type, tissue, condition).
comment: This term was made obsolete because the meaning of the term is ambiguous: the same gene product may or may not have a role in apoptosis depending on the cell type, tissue type, condition, etc.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is ill-defined: phosphorylation regulates the activity of caspases, but it doesn't activate them (caspases are only activated upon cleavage).
comment: This term was created to reflect the fundamental role of the mitochondrial compartment in apoptosis. Most processes under this node occur during the signaling phase of apoptosis, but e.g. GO:0043653 'mitochondrial fragmentation involved in apoptotic process' cannot be confidently placed under the signaling phase. For this reason, the parent term GO:0008637 'apoptotic mitochondrial changes' is not linked to the signaling or execution phase specifically, but its descendants are when current knowledge allows for it.

comment: Note that enzymes with this activity usually also hydrolyze NAD+ to NMN and AMP.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to two different functions, a glutamine amidotransferase that functions as an aminodeoxychorismate synthase [itself composed of two enzymatic activities, a glutaminase and a chorismate aminase (this latter is sometimes referred to as the aminodeoxychorismate synthase)] and a 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate aromatase (4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase). Note that the name 'para-amino benzoate synthase' was initially given to the 'aminodeoxychorismate synthase' activity before the additional lyase activity was discovered.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was not defined, is ambiguous, and has been used to annotate gene products with very different activities.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents three different molecular functions.
comment: Note that this term is not a child of 'recombinase activity ; GO:0000150' because the latter represents activities that do not break or form phosphodiester bonds.
comment: Note that, although the enzyme to which this term refers is also known as 'ribonuclease PH', and degrades tRNA in the 3'-5' direction in vivo, the term does not have parentage in the 'nuclease activity' branch of the ontology because both GO and the Enzyme Commission define nuclease activity as a type of hydrolysis.
comment: Note that this term has a MetaCyc pathway reference as the pathway only has a single step.

comment: 1. Making inferences in GO about compounds based on the coenzyme role curated by ChEBI creates relationships that are not always true which violates ontological principles for GO; therefore we will cease making these inferences. 2. It is not meaningful to group biosynthetic processes that are not all metabolically related by the fact that they may be used as a coenzyme.

comment: See also the molecular function term 'nitrite reductase [NAD(P)H] activity ; GO:0008942'.
comment: Note that in eukaryotes, aspartate carbamoyltransferase is usually a single polypeptide, not a complex, and should therefore not be annotated to this component term.
comment: This term was made obsolete because dihydrolipoamide S-acyltransferase activity resides in a single polypeptide.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the activity dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is held by a single protein (Lpd1 in yeast), which is one of the components of three different complexes: 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and branch chain amino acid dehydrogenase, so dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is not a complex itself.
comment: See also the molecular functions term 'oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (succinyl-transferring) activity ; GO:0004591', 'dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase activity ; GO:0004149' and 'dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity ; GO:0004148'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase itself is not a complex, it is a component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, the activity dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase is contained in a single polypeptide.
comment: See also the molecular function term 'polyphosphate kinase activity ; GO:0008976'.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a phenotype rather than a biological process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'heavy metal' is an ambiguous grouping term which has no set meaning (see Pure Appl. Chem. Vol. 74, No. 5, pp. 793-807, 2002, for more information).
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'response to deep water ; GO:0030912'. Flooding refers to short-term immersion, whereas 'response to deep water ; GO:0030912' refers to standing in water throughout an organism's life cycle.

comment: This is a process composed of two reactions represented by the terms 'GO:0052606 : chlorophyllide a oxygenase activity' and 'GO:0052607 : 7-hydroxy-chlorophyllide a oxygenase activity'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was defined incorrectly: there are no known peptidases using a catalytic mechanism involving arginine and lysine, and the Arabidopsis metacaspases that prompted addition of this term are in fact cysteine-type endopeptidases.
comment: Note that term is to be used to annotate gene products in the plant. To annotate genes in a symbiont, consider the biological process term 'modulation by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052040'.
comment: This term should be used to annotate instances where a cell or organism is responding to a chemical that is playing the role of an acid (e.g. proton donor) and therefore lowering the pH. If instead you wish to describe a response to a specific acid as a chemical, such as the anion portion of glutamate, please annotate to the appropriate child of GO:0001101 'response to acid chemical'.
comment: This class covers any process that regulates the rate of production of a mature gene product, and so includes processes that regulate that rate by regulating the level, stability or availability of intermediates in the process of gene expression.  For example, it covers any process that regulates the level, stability or availability of mRNA or circRNA for translation and thereby regulates the rate of production of the encoded protein via translation.

comment: This process is part of the natural developmental program of some cell types, but it does not always happen as part of the development or shaping of a gross anatomical structure.
comment: This term covers any process that negatively regulates the rate of production of a mature gene product, and so includes processes that negatively regulate that rate by reducing the level, stability or availability of intermediates in the process of gene expression. For example, it covers any process that reduces the level, stability or availability of mRNA or circRNA for translation and thereby reduces the rate of production of the encoded protein via translation.

comment: Note that as agreed during the transcription overhaul, terms specifying binding to specific transcription regulatory motifs are no longer being created. The level of specificity GO has decided to go to is the "core promoter", "core promoter proximal region" and "enhancer". To capture more detail, please consider using column 16.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a phenotype.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the word "promoter" is used ambiguously in the literature. It sometimes is used to refer specifically to the "core promoter" region recognized by the basal transcription machinery, and other times is used to refer to a larger regulatory region composed of the core promoter and also the regulatory region adjacent (proximal) to the core promoter. The core promoter proximal region is typically recognized by "regulatory transcription factors", such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae.
comment: This reaction requires the presence of calcium.
comment: The term was made obsolete because 'proteasome' is not a valid molecular function term.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that those represent specific gene products, and genes annotated to those terms should be annotated to 'regulation of gene expression' or 'regulation of transcription' or some signaling term.

comment: The reason for obsoletion is that those represent specific gene products, and genes annotated to those terms should be annotated to 'regulation of gene expression' or 'regulation of transcription' or some signaling term.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that the term is confusing - it sounds developmental and has a developmental sounding def, but it is not a child of developmental process and its children included 'cellular component assembly'. The term was created to group together 'cellular component assembly' and 'anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis', but we no longer feel that this grouping is useful.
comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select one of the 'regulation' children terms.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it represent an assay - how long the cell lives -, not a true biological process.
comment: Consider also annotating to 'eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase activity ; GO:0004694'.
comment: Note that this term should be used to annotate gene products in the organism undergoing the programmed cell death. To annotate genes in another organism whose products modulate programmed cell death in a host organism, consider the term 'modulation by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052040'. Also, note that 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' should be used to refer to instances of caspase-independent cell death mechanisms, in the absence of further indications on the process taking place. At present, caspase-independent cell death is not yet represented in GO due to the lack of consensus and in-depth research on the topic. 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' may also be used to annotate gene products in taxa where apoptosis as defined in GO:0006915 does not occur, such as plants. You may also consider these specific children: GO:0097468 'programmed cell death in response to reactive oxygen species' (with descendants GO:0010421 'hydrogen peroxide-mediated programmed cell death' and GO:0010343 'singlet oxygen-mediated programmed cell death'), and GO:0009626 'plant-type hypersensitive response' and its children.
comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct manual annotation of gene products. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.
comment: Occurrence of this process outside of the context of muscle repair is probably very rare, so there is a good case for merging this with the parent class.

comment: The reason for obsoletion is that the data from the paper for which the term was requested can be accurately described using 'receptor-mediated endocytosis'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a grouping term representing a set of gene products.
comment: Note that this term specifically refers to the reaction proceeding in the direction shown; under physiological conditions adrenodoxin reduction by adrenodoxin reductase is coupled with electron transfer from AdR to P450, which catalyzes an irreversible monooxygenation reaction. This term should therefore be used to annotate gene products that catalyze the reduction of oxidized adrenodoxin; also consider annotating to the molecular function term 'ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase activity ; GO:0004324'.

comment: Ferric iron is rarely transported in the free form. Some bacteria have a system in which an outer membrane protein takes iron away from host ferritin or lactoferrin and transport it to a Fe3+ binding protein in the periplasm. The periplasmic protein then delivers the Fe3+ to a transport system located in the cytoplasmic membrane. Consider also GO:0015343 siderophore transmembrane transporter activity.

comment: Note that some gene products that possess DNA translocase activity, such as members of the FtsK/SpoIIIE family, can be fixed in place by interactions with other components of the cell; the relative movement between the protein and DNA bound to it results in movement of the DNA within the cell, often across a membrane.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: Note that the type II protein secretion system complex does not include components of the Sec or Tat pathways. For components of these pathways, consider annotating to 'cell envelope Sec complex ; GO:0031522' or 'TAT protein translocation system complex ; GO:0033281'.
comment: Note that this term represents an activity and not a cellular structure. Consider also annotating to the cellular component term 'type II protein secretion system complex ; GO:0015627'. This process refers specifically to secretion across the outer membrane. For components of the Sec and Tat pathways, consider annotating to 'protein transport by the Sec complex ; GO:0043952' and 'protein transport by the Tat complex ; GO:0043953'. Note that this term is used for annotation of proteins that compose the secretion complex but not the proteins being secreted.

comment: This term was made obsolete because the differentia from the parent is a gene product feature (specifically, the presence of a molybdopterin cofactor in the protein). It has also never been defined.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product, and because describing something as an 'antigen' means that an organism can produce antibodies to it, which says nothing about the gene product activity.

comment: This covers fusion of synaptic vesicles trafficked to the synapse as well as fusion of endocytosed vesicles as part of recycling.  It is there for not  part of the synaptic vesicle cycle.
comment: Note that this function was formerly EC:1.14.99.25.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the activity it describes does not exist, and the gene product with the name 'polyketide synthase' has multiple functional domains, so using the name to describe a single function would be misleading.
comment: This term was made obsolete because tRNA thionucleotide formation is a multistep process; there is no single reaction in which cysteine reacts with an activated tRNA directly
comment: Targeted macroautophagy sometimes targets regions of cytoplasm containing non-self, such as virus particles or components (e.g. see PMID:20159618).  As this is essentially the same process as macroautophagy that encloses and digests only self, the term autophagy is still used despite the enclosure of some non-self (non-auto) entities.
comment: Note that this term refers specifically to posttranscriptional mechanisms by which small interfering RNAs down-regulate gene expression. Also consider annotating to other descendants of 'gene silencing by RNA ; GO:0031047'.
comment: General transcription factors assemble with the RNA polymerase at promoter DNA to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC), bind to and open promoter DNA, initiate RNA synthesis and stimulate the escape of the polymerase from the promoter. Not all subunits of the general transcription factor are necessarily present in all promoters to initiate transcription. The distinction between general transcription factors and DNA-binding transcription factors is that the latter modulate the selection of which genes are expressed under specific conditions, while general transcription factors belong to the constitutive machinery required for transcription to occur.
comment: This term was obsoleted because "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription vs "specific" transcription were determined not to be separable, distinct process. Thus, terms trying to distinguish "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription from "specific" transcription were removed from both the Molecular Function and the Biological Process ontologies. In addition, this Molecular Function term was defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to a phenotype. When death of a cell or tissue is a result of a true biological process, this should be captured using 'programmed cell death' or one of its descendants.

comment: The term 'RNA editing' (GO:0016547) was merged into 'RNA modification' (GO:0009451) on the basis of statements in the preface of Modification and Editing of RNA (ISBN:1555811337) that there is no clear distinction between modification and editing. Parallel changes were made for substrate (e.g. tRNA, rRNA, etc.) specific child terms of 'RNA editing'.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism.

comment: Note that this term describes the trans-bilayer motion of a population of phospholipid molecules, and should not be confused with 'phospholipid translocation ; GO:0045332'.
comment: Nomenclature note. Scramblases are ATP-independent, non-selective, translocases inducing non-specific transbilayer movements across the membrane. Flippases and floppases are ATP-dependent transbilayer lipid translocators. According to an extensively used, though not universal, nomenclature, they catalyze lipid transfer towards the inward monolayer (flippases) or towards the outward monolayer (floppases).

comment: Note that the calcium regulated exocytosis pathway can be leaky: some level of exocytosis via this pathway occurs spontaneously.  This phenomenon underlies spontaneous neurotransmitter release from presynapses.  This phenomenon is distinct from the unregulated, calcium independent exocytosis pathway.
comment: This term was obsoleted because "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription vs "specific" transcription were determined not to be separable, distinct process. Thus, terms trying to distinguish "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription from "specific" transcription were removed from both the Molecular Function and the Biological Process ontologies. In addition, this Molecular Function term was defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of your repressor is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.

comment: 1. Making inferences in GO about compounds based on the cofactor role curated by ChEBI creates relationships that are not always true which violates ontological principles for GO; therefore we will cease making these inferences. 2. It is not meaningful to group protein modification processes that are not all chemically related by the fact that they may be used as a cofactor.

comment: Sexual reproduction may be seen as the regular alternation, in the life cycle of haplontic, diplontic and diplohaplontic organisms, of meiosis and fertilization which provides for the production offspring. In diplontic organisms there is a life cycle in which the products of meiosis behave directly as gametes, fusing to form a zygote from which the diploid, or sexually reproductive polyploid, adult organism will develop. In diplohaplontic organisms a haploid phase (gametophyte) exists in the life cycle between meiosis and fertilization (e.g. higher plants, many algae and Fungi); the products of meiosis are spores that develop as haploid individuals from which haploid gametes develop to form a diploid zygote; diplohaplontic organisms show an alternation of haploid and diploid generations. In haplontic organisms meiosis occurs in the zygote, giving rise to four haploid cells (e.g. many algae and protozoa), only the zygote is diploid and this may form a resistant spore, tiding organisms over hard times.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was ill-defined.
comment: Note that this term does not have a relationship to 'vacuole ; GO:0005773' because it does not fit the definition of a vacuole; the parasitophorous vacuole was so named because it resembles a vacuole in the microscope.

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: In plants and animals, dormancy may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. In plants, dormancy may involve the formation of dormant buds, and may be preceded by the senescence of plant parts such as leaves in woody plants or most of the shoot system in herbaceous perennials. The exit from dormancy in vascular plants is marked by resumed growth of buds and/or growth of vascular cambium.

comment: This term was made obsolete because the 'complex' it refers to contains only one gene product.
comment: This term was made obsolete because microtubule-based flagellum (GO:0009434) and motile cilium (GO:0031514), as referenced by this term, were determined to be equivalent and merged. When a merge for this term was considered, it was noticed that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are annotated to it because its meaning had been ambiguous so obsoletion was considered safest.
comment: Note that immunologists typically use the word 'development' to refer to cells of B or T cell lineages undergoing the process that GO describes as 'cell differentiation'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a an abnormal process that is harmful to the organism.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the definition is ambiguous and contains incorrect information. To update annotations of gene products that act as receptors for MHC class I protein complexes, use the molecular function term 'MHC class I receptor activity ; GO:0032393'; to update annotations of gene products which are components of MHC class I protein complexes, use the cellular component term 'MHC class I protein complex ; GO:0042612'.
comment: Note that the term 'secretory vesicle' is sometimes used in this sense, but can also mean 'secretory granule ; GO:0030141'.
comment: Note that the term 'secretory vesicle' is sometimes used in this sense, but can also mean 'transport vesicle ; GO:0030133'.

comment: This term was made obsolete because its definition was inaccurate.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a regulator of a non-existent molecular function.
comment: This term refers to the breakdown of mature proteins. For cleavage events involved in generating a mature protein from a precursor, consider instead the term 'protein maturation ; GO:0051604' and its children.
comment: A filopodium may be approximately 0.1 um wide, 5-10 um long, and up to 50 um long in axon growth cones; contain a loose bundle of about 20 actin filaments oriented with their plus ends pointing outward. Note that filopodia on dendritic shafts are distinct from other types of filopodia (even those found in dendritic growth cones) and may react differently to stimuli, as shown in PMID:12904473.

comment: Extracellular matrix mucin proteins may be annotated to this term. PMID:14711375, PMID:18601586
comment: Note that the term 'thymocyte differentiation' was merged into this term because thymocytes are T cells, and thus the term was essentially redundant. Note that immunologists typically use the word 'development' to refer to cells of B or T cell lineages undergoing the process that GO describes as 'cell differentiation'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because no known receptor binds apolipoprotein E; instead, receptors bind holo-lipoprotein E (apolipoprotein E + bound lipid).
comment: This term is intended for cell surface receptors that bind and internalize a lipoprotein particle. For members of the lipoprotein receptor family that transduce a signal rather than endocytose their ligand, consider instead the terms 'signaling receptor activity ; GO:0038023' and its children, or 'reelin receptor activity ; GO:0038025'.
comment: GO:0030234 is reserved for cases when the regulator directly interacts with the enzyme. When regulation of enzyme activity is achieved without enzyme binding, or when the mechanism of regulation is unknown, instead annotate to 'regulation of catalytic activity ; GO:0050790'.
comment: See also 'regulation of nitric-oxide synthase activity ; GO:0050999'.
comment: Note that this term represents an activity and not a cellular structure. Consider also annotating to the cellular component term 'type I protein secretion system complex ; GO:0030256'.
comment: Note that this term represents an activity and not a cellular structure. Consider also annotating to the cellular component term 'type III protein secretion system complex ; GO:0030257'.

comment: Note that this term represents a location and not a function; the activity possessed by this complex is mentioned in the definition for the purpose of describing and distinguishing the complex. The function possessed by this complex is represented by the molecular function term 'ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase activity ; GO:0103012'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.

comment: See also the biological process terms 'ERAD pathway ; GO:0036503', 'unfolded protein response ; GO:0030968' and 'retrograde protein transport, ER to cytosol ; GO:0030970'.
comment: Note that the synonym 'spore differentiation', like the term name and definition, refers to differentiation into a spore rather than any subsequent developmental changes that a spore may undergo.
comment: Note that ascospores and asci are separate biological structures. The ascus is the structure that contain the ascospores, but the development of the ascus is a different process than the formation of the ascospores themselves; for instance, some mutations affect sporulation without affecting ascus development. For this reason, GO:0030437 ascospore formation and GO:0075317 ascus development are different terms and are not linked.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a combination of gene product features and involvement in a biological process.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism.

comment: Noc complexes exhibit a dynamic intranuclear location; consider also annotating to 'nucleolus ; GO:0005730' and/or 'nucleoplasm ; GO:0005654'. Note that the definition uses Saccharomyces gene product names because this complex has only been described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and no other names have yet arisen; the term nevertheless can be used for analogous complexes in other eukaryotes, and the definition can be changed if better wording is found.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: Note that the term name mentions a specific position within a tRNA because no other names have yet arisen for this activity, and because the position is conserved in nearly all tRNAs. The term nevertheless can be used for activities that methylase an analogous residue at a position other than 54, if such is found, and synonyms that mention positions applicable to other tRNAs or species may also be added.
comment: Note that this term represents a location and not a function; the activity possessed by this complex is mentioned in the definition for the purpose of describing and distinguishing the complex. The function possessed by this complex is represented by the molecular function term 'glycine reductase activity ; GO:0030699'.
comment: This term may be used to annotate both partners in a GTP-dependent binding interaction, both the GTP-bound protein and the protein(s) which interact with it.
comment: Note that the enzyme arsenite methyltransferase also has methylarsonite methyltransferase activity (GO:0030792).

comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'response to unfolded protein ; GO:0006986', which refers to any response to the presence of unfolded proteins anywhere in the cell or in multicellular organism. Also see 'ER-associated protein catabolic process ; GO:0030433'.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this process represent a single step (molecular function) of the IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response (GO:0036498).
comment: This term was obsoleted because it refers to targets of effector proteins (caspases); the 'cleavage' process referred to in the term name is in fact the same molecular function represented by GO:0097200 'cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in execution phase of apoptosis'.

comment: Note that this term is a child of 'actin cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis ; GO:0030036' because the actin cytoskeleton is defined as actin filaments and associated proteins.
comment: Note that this term is a child of 'actin cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis ; GO:0030036' because the actin cytoskeleton is defined as actin filaments and associated proteins; myosin structures are sufficiently closely associated with actin filaments to be included with the actin cytoskeleton.
comment: Note that this term refers to breakage of chromosomes during normal DNA rearrangements characteristic of ciliates; it is not to be used for DNA damage or other abnormal occurrences.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: Note that proteins intrinsic to membranes cannot be removed without disrupting the membrane, e.g. by detergent.
comment: Consider also annotating to 'cell cortex ; GO:0005938'.
comment: In GO, 'external side' still refers to part of the membrane and does not refer to components beyond (outside of) the membrane.
comment: In GO, 'internal side' still refers to part of the membrane and does not refer to components beyond (inside of) the membrane.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'unfolded protein binding ; GO:0051082', which usually refers to proteins that have not yet folded into their active states. Denatured proteins once were in their correct functional conformations, but have become incorrectly folded, and often form aggregates.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it corresponds to a wide range of substrates not necessarily transported by the same transporter. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine.
comment: Gene products that may be annotated to this term include: 1) ligand-bound receptors such as FAS/CD95 (though care should be taken because FAS can also act as a non-apoptotic signal transducer); 2) signaling molecules such as FADD (FAS-associated protein with a death domain), cIAPs (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins), c-FLIPs and caspases 8 and 10.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: Type II refers to the type of fatty acid synthase. Type I is in a complex, type II is not.
comment: Obsoleted because type II fatty acid synthases are not complexes
comment: Obsoleted because type II fatty acid synthase is not a complex.
comment: Use this term to annotate conjugated tags, not for conjugating enzymes. At the time of writing, all known gene products with this activity are ubiquitin-like, either based on overall sequence similarity or the presence of common motifs and structures.
comment: Note that although this organelle is commonly referred to as a 'vesicle' or 'vacuole' in the literature, it is not surrounded by a membrane.
comment: Note that although gas vesicles are commonly referred to as 'vesicles' or 'vacuoles' in the literature, they are not surrounded by a membrane.
comment: Note that GO:0004169 'dolichyl-phosphate-mannose-protein mannosyltransferase activity' (part of protein O-linked mannosylation) has never been observed in green plants. However, N- and C-mannosylation may occur in these species; see figure 1 in PMID:21558543.
comment: Note that this term represents the protein complex involved in transport of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. For proteins involved in bacterial type II secretion across the outer membrane, consider annotating to 'type II protein secretion complex ; GO:0015628'. For proteins involved in Sec-complex dependent translocation into the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum, consider annotating to 'endoplasmic reticulum Sec complex ; GO:0031205'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is now superseded by better defined and more specific terms under the node of GO:0012501 programmed cell death.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is now superseded by better defined and more specific terms under the node of GO:0006915 apoptotic process.
comment: Note that the phrase 'oxidosqualene cyclase' has been used to refer to enzymes that catalyze the reaction represented by 'lanosterol synthase activity ; GO:0000250'.
comment: The reason this term was made obsolete is that the two terms cytokinesis checkpoint (GO:0031565) and cytokinesis after mitosis (GO:0000078) were conflated in meaning.
comment: Note that this term should only be used as a grouping term for the mitotic and meiotic G2 DNA damage checkpoints, and should not be used for direct manual annotation. You should always be able to choose one of its child terms instead.
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct manual annotation as it should always be possible to choose either a mitotic or meiotic child term.
comment: This term is intended to cover steps in a GPCR signaling pathway both upstream and downstream of phospholipase D (PLD) activation.
comment: Note that wybutosine is a hypermodified G-residue, formerly called the Y-base, and its derivatives are exclusively found at position 37 (anticodon loop) of tRNAPhe.
comment: Note that the centrosomal corona has been observed in Dictyostelium, and is the functional equivalent of pericentriolar material.
comment: In vertebrates, the term 'neuromuscular junction' is limited to synapses targeting skeletal muscle fibers - all of which are  cholinergic and excitatory.  Both inhibitory and excitatory neuromuscular junctions exist in invertebrates, utilizing a range of neurotransmitters including glutamate, GABA and 5-HT.

comment: Note that this term refers to a subcellular structure, and should not be confused with the specialized cells known as xanthophores, which produce yellow pigment and are found in fish and amphibian skin. Note that several terms in the biological process ontology ('xanthophore differentiation ; GO:0050936' and its children) refer to xanthophores in the sense of pigment-producing cells.
comment: The term has been obsoleted because it represents a GO-CAM model.

comment: The term has been obsoleted because it represents a GO-CAM model.
comment: See also the cellular component term 'heterotrimeric G-protein complex ; GO:0005834'.
comment: The reason for obsoleting is that it is an arbitrary grouping term that groups the molecular functions required for the G-protein complex cycle, and this is not a bona fide biological process.
comment: Note that this term refers to a subcellular structure characteristic of ciliate protozoans, and should not be confused with oral anatomical structures of multicellular animals.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'torso signaling pathway ; GO:0008293', although torso is abbreviated 'tor'.
comment: This term was obsoleted because there is no heterochromatin at the telomere and the term had been used inconsistently.
comment: Note that this term refers only to the actin portion of a microfilament, and does not encompass associated proteins. See also the cellular component term 'actin filament ; GO:0005884'.
comment: For cortisol receptors that act in the nucleus to regulate transcription, consider also annotating to the terms: ligand-activated sequence-specific DNA binding RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity ; GO:0038049' or ligand-activated RNA polymerase II transcription factor binding transcription factor activity ; GO:0038049'.
comment: Note that this term refers to membrane-bounded compartments that are not considered organelles in their own right, but form parts of larger organelles.
comment: In Giardia species, mitosomes are sometimes present between the two nuclei.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it was added in error; it does not refer to a normal subcellular structure.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is ill-defined: channel activities are part of ion transport processes, and not the other way round.

comment: The term 'symmetric' in this name refers only to gross morphology.  There is no implication of functional symmetry.
comment: The reason for making this term obsolete is that it gets misused in cases where phosphates are simply being removed from a small molecule. We found no cases where these molecules genuinely underwent catabolism.
comment: Note that DNA geometric change and DNA topological change (GO:0006265) are distinct, but are usually coupled in vivo.
comment: Note that this term is intended for annotation of gene products that act as receptors for MHC class I protein complexes, not for components of the MHC class I protein complexes themselves.
comment: Note that this term is intended for annotation of gene products that act as receptors for MHC class Ib protein complexes, not for components of the MHC class Ib protein complexes themselves.
comment: Note that this term is intended for annotation of gene products that act as receptors for MHC class II protein complexes, not for components of the MHC class II protein complexes themselves.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with any of the molecular function and biological process terms that refer to the small GTPase ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor).
comment: In GO, 'external side' still refers to part of the membrane and does not refer to components beyond (outside of) the membrane.
comment: Note that this term refers to a geometric change in DNA conformation, and should not be confused with 'DNA topological change ; GO:0006265'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because "nutrient" is not defined, and does not have a consistent meaning.
comment: The dynamic nature of the cortical ER and the movements it undergoes (branching and ring closure) has been shown in both yeast and mammalian cells, so appears highly conserved. (PMID:10931860)

comment: Note that, in some cases, viral RNA replication and viral transcription from RNA actually refer to the same process, but may be called differently depending on the focus of a specific research study.
comment: Note that a larger complex containing Sm proteins and other subunits is also sometimes referred to as the 'SMN complex'. The larger complex is represented by 'SMN-Sm protein complex ; GO:0034719'.
comment: Note that this term refers to Schizosaccharomyces pombe Swi5, which should not be confused with the unrelated Saccharomyces Swi5p.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that those represent specific gene products, and genes annotated to those terms should be annotated to 'regulation of gene expression' or 'regulation of transcription' or some signaling term.
comment: Note that as agreed during the transcription overhaul, terms specifying binding to specific transcription regulatory motifs are no longer being created. The level of specificity GO has decided to go to is the "core promoter", "core promoter proximal region" and "enhancer". To capture more detail, please consider using column 16.

comment: Annotation to this term should be done with caution, particularly if the mechanism is not well clarified.
comment: A protein complex in this context is meant as a stable set of interacting proteins which can be co-purified by an acceptable method, and where the complex has been shown to exist as an isolated, functional unit in vivo. Acceptable experimental methods include stringent protein purification followed by detection of protein interaction. The following methods should be considered non-acceptable: simple immunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments from cell extracts without further purification, colocalization and 2-hybrid screening. Interactions that should not be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate, receptor/ligand or any similar transient interactions, unless these are a critical part of the complex assembly or are required e.g. for the receptor to be functional; 2) proteins associated in a pull-down/co-immunoprecipitation assay with no functional link or any evidence that this is a defined biological entity rather than a loose-affinity complex; 3) any complex where the only evidence is based on genetic interaction data; 4) partial complexes, where some subunits (e.g. transmembrane ones) cannot be expressed as recombinant proteins and are excluded from experiments (in this case, independent evidence is necessary to find out the composition of the full complex, if known). Interactions that may be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate or receptor/ligand if the complex can only assemble and become functional in the presence of both classes of subunits; 2) complexes where one of the members has not been shown to be physically linked to the other(s), but is a homologue of, and has the same functionality as, a protein that has been experimentally demonstrated to form a complex with the other member(s); 3) complexes whose existence is accepted based on localization and pharmacological studies, but for which experimental evidence is not yet available for the complex as a whole.
comment: Macromolecular complexes in which the carbohydrate component is all covalently bound to protein are not considered protein carbohydrate complexes.
comment: Note that this term is intended to classify complexes that have DNA as one of the members of the complex, that is, the complex does not exist if DNA is not present. Protein complexes that interact with DNA e.g. transcription factor complexes should not be classified here.
comment: Macromolecular complexes in which the lipid component is all covalently bound to protein are not considered protein-lipid complexes.
comment: Note that this term represents the return of mast cell levels to stable numbers following an immune response as well as the proliferation and elimination of mast cells required to maintain stable numbers in the absence of an outside stimulus.
comment: Many paralogs of Rad51 act as recombinase mediators. These paralogs dimerize (or occasionally form tetramers) amongst themselves to form complexes with ssDNA-binding activity, and which act as mediators of Rad51 presynaptic filament assembly.

comment: Note that this term represents an activity and not a cellular structure. Consider also annotating to the cellular component term 'type VI protein secretion system complex ; GO:0033104'.
comment: Note that the chlorosome envelope is not a single or double lipid bilayer, so this term is not a child of 'organelle membrane ; GO:0031090' or 'organelle envelope ; GO:0031967'.

comment: This term was made obsolete because nucleoprotein filament formation does not require ATP hydrolysis, so the term is misleading.
comment: In yeast the subunits are MSI1/p50, CAC2/p60 and CAC1/p90.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents two reactions, and should be two separate terms.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents two reactions, and should be two separate terms.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it is an unnecessary grouping class.
comment: There is no annotated example of this MF; therefore we cannot classify it more precisely.
comment: This term was made obsolete because cell cycle phases are intervals and so cannot be regulated as such, rather it is the transitions between the phases that are regulated. This term was often also used to annotate genes which should have been annotated to 'regulation of DNA replication', or one of its children.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.
comment: Note that this term should be used only for abortive mitotic events that occur normally, e.g. during megakaryocyte differentiation; it should not be used for incomplete mitosis resulting from mutation or other abnormal occurrences. Note that this term should not be confused with 'endomitotic cell cycle ; GO:0007113', which describes a process in which no mitotic spindle forms.
comment: Note that this term should be used for naturally occurring instances of mitosis without cytokinesis, e.g. in the tapetum of flowers and in a number of lower eukaryotes; it should not be used for abnormal events such as may occur in cancers.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was added in error; formation of an actin dimer is simply a transient step in the polymerization of actin. Also, this term may not represent a real molecular function in GO, but rather that a gene product (actin itself) is part of an actin homodimer transient protein complex.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents two reactions, and should be two separate terms.
comment: Note that this term is equivalent to the obsolete molecular function term 'deoxyhypusine synthase activity ; GO:0004171' and corresponds closely to the biological process term 'deoxyhypusine biosynthetic process from spermidine, using deoxyhypusine synthase ; GO:0050983'.
comment: Note that this term is to be used to annotate gene products in the host, not the symbiont. To annotate gene products in the symbiont that induce programmed cell death in the host, consider the biological process term 'positive regulation by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052042'.

comment: Note that this term is not synonymous with 'heterophilic cell adhesion ; GO:0007157'; the process may occur by homophilic or heterophilic mechanisms.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents binding to an individual protein.
comment: Note that this term is to be used only to annotate gene products that bind to lipid-free APOA1. For receptors that bind lipid-associated apolipoproteins (plasma lipoprotein particles), consider annotating to 'lipoprotein receptor activity ; GO:0030228' or its child terms.
comment: Note that this term does not fall under the general GO definition for biosynthetic processes, which is 'The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of... ', because amyloid-beta can only be formed by the proteolysis of a larger molecule (see term definition). The word 'formation' is therefore used in place of biosynthesis. Also, note that this term refers to the production of the amyloid-beta polypeptide from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and should be used to annotate e.g. secretases that cleave APP to form amyloid-beta. To annotate gene products involved in the formation of amyloid fibrils, please consider 'amyloid fibril formation' (GO:1990000).

comment: An example of this is P2xA in Dictyostelium (UniProt symbol Q86JM7) in PMID:24335649.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with '1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase, class IA complex; GO:0005943' or '1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase, class IB complex ; GO:0005944'.

comment: Note that basidiospores and basidia are separate biological structures. The basidium is the structure that bear the basidiospores, but the development of the basidium is a different process than the formation of the basidiospores themselves. For this reason, GO:0034295 basidiospore formation and GO:0075313 basidium development are different terms and are not linked.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with the usage of 'blastospore' to mean any yeast-form fungal cell, as in Candida species.
comment: Note that this term was reinstated from obsolete.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is unclear whether the term represents the action of the receptor or the entire process of transcription regulation. The term 'nuclear hormone receptor' is also misleading since many of these receptors reside in the cytoplasm until they are bound by a ligand.
comment: Note that IL-28A, IL-28B, and IL-29 are types of interferon-lambda. This term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select one of the 'regulation' children terms.

comment: Note that the term name uses Saccharomyces gene product names because no other names have yet arisen for this complex; the term nevertheless can be used for analogous complexes in other eukaryotes, and the name can be changed if better wording is found.
comment: Note that this term should be used for annotating gene products with caution: it should be used only to annotate gene products demonstrated to reside and function normally in the autophagic vacuole lumen, not for molecules that are temporarily found in the lumen prior to degradation.
comment: This term was obsoleted because there is no transmembrane transporter specific for glycoproteins.

comment: This term was obsoleted because it represents a GO-CAM model.
comment: Note that the term string was changed to be consistent with placement of this term in cell aging hierarchy.
comment: Note that this complex is sometimes referred to as the 'SMN complex', but it should not be confused with GO:0032797.
comment: Note that the subunits of TFIIIB-beta are conserved between human and yeast; however, in yeast a single TFIIIB complex regulates transcription of tRNA, 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA genes, whereas two different TBP-dependent TFIIIB activities exist in humans.

comment: Note that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
comment: Note that this term has no relationship to 'membrane disassembly ; GO:0030397' because the basement membrane is not a lipid bilayer.
comment: Note that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was derived from a UM-BBD enzyme entry that has been deleted, and no other information can be found to suggest that it is a naturally occurring activity.

comment: Note that this term refers to Schizosaccharomyces pombe Swi5 and Swi2, which should not be confused with the unrelated Saccharomyces Swi5p and Swi2p.
comment: Note that this term should be used to annotate gene products found in cohesin complexes in organisms that undergo closed mitosis (i. e. where the nuclear envelope does not break down, as in fungi). For organisms in which the nuclear envelope breaks down during mitosis, the parent should be used.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with the cellular component term 'perinuclear region ; GO:0048471'.
comment: Note that the gene/protein name 'APC' should not be confused with the abbreviation for 'anaphase promoting complex'.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it likely represents an assay for GO:0099115 chromosome, subtelomeric region.

comment: See also the molecular function term 'histone deacetylase activity ; GO:0004407'.
comment: See also the molecular function term 'histone acetyltransferase activity ; GO:0004402'.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that all proteins are imported into the nucleus via the same mechanism, so the import of individual proteins should be captured with extensions or by GO-CAM models.
comment: See also the cellular component term 'nuclear speck ; GO:0016607'.
comment: Note that cilia and eukaryotic flagella are deemed to be equivalent.
comment: In Drosophila the core subunits are Pc (Polycomb), Psc (Posterior sex combs), Ph (Polyhomeotic) and Sce (Sex comb extra). In mammals, which have several orthologs for each of the Drosophila core proteins, a family of distinct PRC1-like complexes seem to exist which contain at least some PcG proteins in mutually exclusive manner.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that all proteins are imported into the nucleus via the same mechanism, so the import of individual proteins should be captured with extensions or by GO-CAM models.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the term 'limb' is not widely used in the insect community. In GO, 'limb' is used to describe the vertebrate hindlimbs and forelimbs.
comment: This term was made obsolete because leg is a mechano-functional grouping, and having both 'leg morphogenesis' and 'hindlimb morphogenesis' terms causes errors in querying.
comment: This term was made obsolete because leg is a mechano-functional grouping, and having both 'leg morphogenesis' and 'hindlimb morphogenesis' terms causes errors in querying.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'tail' has different meanings in different organisms, and is therefore not a useful grouping term.
comment: Behavior such as predation which involves members of different species is not social. Communication between members of different species is also not social behavior.

comment: Type III protein arginine methyltransferases catalyze the single methylation of one of the terminal nitrogen atoms of the guanidino group in an L-arginine residue within a protein. Unlike type I and type II protein arginine methyltransferases, which also catalyze this reaction, type III enzymes do not methylate the substrate any further.
comment: Note that type I protein arginine N-methyltransferase enzymes possess 'protein-arginine omega-N monomethyltransferase activity ; GO:0035241' and 'protein-arginine omega-N asymmetric methyltransferase activity ; GO:0035242'.
comment: Note that type II protein arginine N-methyltransferase enzymes possess 'protein-arginine omega-N monomethyltransferase activity ; GO:0035241' and 'protein-arginine omega-N symmetric methyltransferase activity ; GO:0035243'.

comment: Despite its name, the pre-BCR is not a receptor complex, as it appears to provide a low level of signal not dependent on a ligand, but rather simply on correct assembly of the complex as a measure for correct Ig heavy chain recombination and folding. A significant proportion of pre-BCR complexes fail to reach the cell surface, and in some cases may provide their signaling function from the trans-Golgi network or lysosome.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes regulation of the nodal signaling pathway. Nodal proteins are members of the TGF-beta superfamily, but are distinct from TGF-beta proteins themselves. TGF-beta proteins are not currently known to regulate left/right asymmetry in the lateral mesoderm.
comment: Note that as agreed during the transcription overhaul, terms specifying binding to specific transcription regulatory motifs are no longer being created. The level of specificity GO has decided to go to is the "core promoter", "core promoter proximal region" and "enhancer". To capture more detail, please consider using column 16.

comment: Eukaryotic microorganisms, plants, and probably Gram-positive bacteria, possess a homopolymeric urease. In contrast, urease complexes from gram-negative bacteria studied thus far clearly possess three distinct subunits (alpha, beta and gamma). Tightly bound nickel is present in all urease complexes.

comment: This term should only be used when Wnt receptor signaling occurs via a beta-catenin-independent route but the downstream effectors are unknown. If the downstream effectors are known, consider instead annotating to one of the children, or requesting a new term.
comment: This term was made obsolete because N-terminal proline residues cannot be trimethylated.
comment: Preventing a ligand from binding to its cell surface receptor be achieved by binding to the ligand directly, or by binding to members of a ligand-containing complex.
comment: Confining BMP in the extracellular matrix may be achieved by binding BMP directly, or by binding to members of a BMP-containing complex.
comment: A signaling adaptor can bring together both protein and non-protein molecules within a signaling pathway. Scaffold proteins act in at least four ways: tethering signaling components, localizing these components to specific areas of the cell, regulating signal transduction by coordinating positive and negative feedback signals, and insulating correct signaling proteins from competing proteins (PMID:19104498).
comment: Note that peptidyl-L-beta-methylthioaspartic acid is typical of bacterial ribosomal protein S12.
comment: This term should not be used to annotate the nitrosylating action of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) if the nitroso group is synthesized directly on the substrate.
comment: This term is a child of 'cell projection' and not 'cell hair' to distinguish it from animal cell hairs, which are morphologically distinct.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it should be captured as a GO-CAM model.
comment: Note that the only known alpha amino glycosylation is on an asparagine; see UniProtKB:P58522. However, this feature is not differentiated from normal N-glycosylation of asparagine.
comment: Bone mineralization can also occur after a fracture and as a response to stress; in these cases, consider using the term 'bone mineralization ; GO:0030282'.
comment: Homeostasis and maintenance processes are regulatory processes, therefore, regulation child terms, such as: regulation of maintenance of blood-brain barrier, should not exist for these terms. \nInstead, for capturing regulation at the blood-brain barrier, consider using the part_of child term: regulation of blood-brain barrier permeability.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it was a grouping term but had no subclasses.
comment: For changes in locomotory behavior upon introduction to a novel environment, consider instead the child term: locomotory exploration behavior ; GO:0035641.

comment: Depending on the species, this region may have a distinct geometrically shaped electron-dense structure within the axonemal lumen visible in electron microscopy images; most animals don't display this inner structure. The axoneme extends through the ciliary transition zone, but only consists of the outer doublets. The central pair, axonemal spokes, and dynein complexes are not found in this part of the ciliary shaft. Note that the connecting cilium of the photoreceptor cells is thought to be equivalent to the transition zone.

comment: Although there is some evidence, it is still unclear if the MKS and NPHP complexes are constituents parts of the Y-shaped links or are simply responsible for aligning and attaching the Y-shaped links to the membrane and axoneme.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it accidentally reused an exisiting id. See replacement term GO:0044393.

comment: In most eukaryotic cells, 'ciliary basal body' (GO:0036064) and 'centriole' (GO:0005814) represent a common entity that cycles through its function in cell division, then ciliogenesis, then cell division again. However, these structures are modified extensively as they transition into each other, and may contain different proteins, specific to each component.
comment: Some intramembranous ossification may also be classified as metaplastic; the former classifies based on tissue type location, and the latter based on mechanism/cell division.
comment: Ligamentous ossification may occur via replacement ossification or metaplastic ossification or both in any one instance.

comment: Currently identified mPTSs vary greatly in length, and cannot be distinguished by primary structure analysis, suggesting that the peroxisomal sorting information is not contained within a specific amino acid sequence. There do however appear to be two classes of mPTSs: class 1 mPTSs that are bound by PEX19 and imported in a PEX19-dependent manner, and class 2 mPTSs that are not bound by PEX19 and mediate protein import independently of PEX19. The two classes cannot be defined based on their amino acid sequence.

comment: For fatty acid beta-oxidation multienzyme complexes located in the mitochondrial matrix, consider instead the term 'mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation multienzyme complex ; GO:0016507'.
comment: Note that cilia and eukaryotic flagella are deemed to be equivalent. In this case community usage is always 'flagellum', hence the primary term name, but the cilium parentage is deliberate.

comment: Note that this is the reverse of the reaction described in '15-oxoprostaglandin 13-oxidase activity ; GO:0047522'.
comment: Note that the KEGG_REACTION:R05060 reaction does not stipulate the acceptor group, and is therefore slightly more general than the activity described by GO:0036133.
comment: Mating type switching is not considered a type of phenotypic switching: for mating type switching, consider instead annotating to 'mating type switching ; GO:0007533'.
comment: This term was created even though it describes a process relating to a group of gene products, because histones are highly conserved proteins that are essential components of cellular chromatin in eukaryotic cells.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it referes to a specific gene product. The gene product should be captured as an annotation extension using 'has input'.

comment: While XTP is not produced by cells, deamination of purine bases can result in accumulation of such nucleotides as ITP, dITP, XTP, and dXTP. XTPase contributes to the removal of these abnormal bases from the cellular pool of nucleotide triphosphates.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is superfluous, as only the more specific 'mitotic G2 cell cycle arrest in response to glucose starvation' has been observed.
comment: In the catabolism of glutamate in mammals, succinate semialdehyde is converted to succinate (see GO:0006540). Plants can utilize an alternative route, converting succinic semialdehyde to 4-hydroxybutyrate using gamma-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase.
comment: While mammals only have 2-oxoglutarate-dependent GABA-transaminase, both 2-oxoglutarate-dependent and pyruvate-dependent GABA-transaminase activities have been detected in plants.
comment: This function is similar to EC:1.2.1.24 [succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+)], and EC:1.2.1.16 [succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)], but is specific for NADP+.

comment: In contrast to EC:3.5.1.41 (chitin deacetylase) this enzyme is specific for the chitin disaccharide.
comment: Consider also annotating to the cellular component term: SREBP-SCAP-Insig complex ; GO:0032937.
comment: For the transition of leukocytes from rolling to adhered, consider instead annotating to 'leukocyte adhesive activation ; GO:0050902'.
comment: This reaction is the intramolecular cyclization of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate to cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and is the second step in the biosynthesis of cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (cDPG).
comment: This reaction is the first step in the biosynthesis of cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (cDPG).
comment: Light adaptation is usually a combination of cell desensitization and response acceleration.
comment: This term describes pre-replicative complexes across organisms.
comment: Despite their naming, neuropeptide F (NPF) and short neuropeptide F (sNPF) are not closely related.
comment: This activity produces the S-enantiomer of HPETE, 8(S)-HPETE. For the reaction producing the S-enantiomer, see GO:0047677.
comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation. The only exception should be when experimental data (e.g., staining with trypan blue or propidium iodide) show that cell death has occurred in response to an oxidative stress stimulus, but fail to provide details on death modality (accidental versus programmed). When information is provided on the cell death mechanism, annotations should be made to the appropriate descendant of 'cell death' (such as, but not limited to, GO:0097300 'programmed necrotic cell death', GO:0006915 'apoptotic process' or GO:0097468 'programmed cell death in response to reactive oxygen species'). Also, if experimental data suggest that a gene product influences cell death indirectly, rather than being involved in the death process directly, consider annotating to a 'regulation' term.

comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation. The only exception should be when experimental data (e.g., staining with trypan blue or propidium iodide or use of neuron-specific markers) show that neuron death has occurred, but fail to provide details on death modality (accidental versus programmed).

comment: GO:0036478 is reserved for cases when the activator directly interacts with L-dopa decarboxylase. When activation of L-dopa decarboxylase activity is achieved without enzyme binding, or when the mechanism of regulation is unknown, instead annotate to 'positive regulation of L-dopa decarboxylase activity ; GO:1903200'.
comment: GO:0036479 is reserved for cases when the inhibitor directly interacts with the peroxidase. When inhibition of peroxidase activity is achieved without enzyme binding, or when the mechanism of regulation is unknown, instead annotate to 'negative regulation of peroxidase activity ; GO:2000469'.
comment: Consider also annotating to 'eiF2alpha phosphorylation in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress ; GO:0036492' or its descendants.
comment: ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathways target misfolded ER lumenal proteins (ERAD-L), ER membrane proteins (ERAD-M), and ER proteins with misfolded cytosolic domains (ERAD-C) by recognizing aberrant proteins, retrotranslocating these substrates to the cytosol, followed by substrate ubiquitination and proteosomal-mediated degradation. In contrast the stress-induced homeostatically regulated protein degradation (SHRED) pathway (GO:0120174), although inducible by stress, targets diverse ER membrane, and cytosolic proteins as well as numerous other native proteins in the absence of stress. Stress results in the protease-mediated (Nma111p) generation of a Roq1p cleavage product that then binds to the type-1 active site of Ubr1p, altering its substrate specificity, and leading to the proteasome-mediated degradation of both misfolded and native proteins. Although the SHRED pathway may contain some components in common with ERAD pathways (GO:0036503), such as UBR1, RAD6 and CDC48, other ERAD components, such as HRD1 and DOA10, do not appear to be involved, and as such these pathways are currently considered to be distinct.

comment: The Derlin-1 retrotranslocation complex is likely to assemble in steps, thereby containing different components at different stages of the retrotranslocation process.
comment: Glycation is a non enzymatic covalent addition of a sugar or dicarbonyl (methylglyoxal, glyoxal) to a protein. Deglycation repairs the glycated amino acids.
comment: This term should be used with caution, and only used when the signaling between cells has been clearly distinguished from endocrine signaling.
comment: This term should be used with caution, and only used when the signaling between cells has been clearly distinguished from paracrine signaling.
comment: Notes: (1) this term and its child terms are intended for receptors that bind to and internalize molecules by receptor-mediated endocytosis. For receptors that are coupled to a signal transduction pathway, consider instead the term 'signaling receptor activity ; GO:0038023' and its children. (2) Cargo receptors transport substances by vesicular transport, not by transmembrane transport.  For transmembrane transporters, consider instead the term 'transmembrane transporter activity ; GO:0022857.
comment: This term is intended for use by G protein-coupled receptors which signal at a low-level in the absence of agonist binding.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it should be captured as a GO-CAM model.

comment: In GO, a gene product with 'vascular endothelial growth factor-activated receptor activity ; GO:0005021' necessarily binds VEGF to transduce a signal. To represent cross-talk between ligands and receptors, signaling pathways in GO are starting to be named after the receptor and/or the signal. GO:0038084 is for annotation of any pathway in which the ligand VEGF binds and activates any cell surface receptor (VEGFR, PDGFR etc.). For annotation of signaling pathways where a VEGFR binds one of its physiological ligands (VEGF or an alternative growth factor), consider 'vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway ; GO:0048010'.
comment: This term refers to inhibition of a member of the activin receptor family; activin receptors bind to multiple ligands including activin and nodal.
comment: Nodal signals through activin receptors but (unlike activin) also requires EGF-CFC coreceptors (such as Cripto or Cryptic in mammals) to signal. This term is intended for receptor/co-receptor components and not a nodal-receptor complex.
comment: This term is for annotation of gene products that bind to TGFbeta. For gene products that tether the TGFbeta-containing latency complex to the extracellular matrix, but do not necessarily bind TGF-beta directly, consider instead annotating to 'sequestering of TGFbeta in extracellular matrix ; GO:0035583'.
comment: The C-C chemokine CCL19 s a known agonist of the chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7). Consider instead annotating to the child term 'CCL19-activated CCR7 signaling pathway ; GO:0038119'.
comment: The C-C chemokine CCL21 s a known agonist of the chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7). Consider instead annotating to the child term 'CCL21-activated CCR7 signaling pathway ; GO:0038120'.
comment: This term was created to show the binding of cytokines to multiple receptor types, and vice-versa. Known agonists of chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) are C-C chemokines CCL19 and CCL21. Consider instead annotating to one of the child terms 'CCL19-activated CCR7 signaling pathway ; GO:0038119' and/or 'CCL21-activated CCR7 signaling pathway ; GO:0038120'.
comment: Consider also annotating to 'ERBB3 signaling pathway ; GO:0038129' and/or 'ERBB4 signaling pathway ; GO:0038130'.
comment: In addition to somatostatin (SST), the somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) can also be activated by the agonist cortistatin (CST). For signal transduction specifically initiated by the ligand somatostatin, consider instead annotating to the child term 'somatostatin signaling pathway ; GO:0038170'.
comment: There are two classes of receptors for neurotrophins: p75 and the Trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors.
comment: Nerve growth factor (NGF) binds at least two classes of receptors: the p75 LNGFR (low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) and TrkA, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase.
comment: This term is intended for annotation of fish and other organisms which contain a glomerulus as part of the pronephric nephron. It should not be used for annotation of Xenopus, which contains a pronephric glomus rather than a glomerulus.
comment: This term should be used for annotation when it is not known which cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor (PRR) has detected the viral RNA. If the PRR is known, consider instead the child terms. The RIG-like family is composed of at least RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I; also known as DDX58), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5; also known as helicard or IFIH1) and LGP2.
comment: The apoptosis effect triggered by the RIG-I signaling pathway is inconclusive and may represent an in-vitro phenomenon. Therefore, in GO the term 'RIG-I signaling pathway ; GO:0039529' is positioned under 'regulation of cytokine production' as this is its primary effect.
comment: This term is for annotation of viral proteins that counteract the host anti-viral innate immune response initiated by host RIG-I, either by binding and inhibiting host RIG-I directly, or by interfering with other processes so that RIG-I is unable to carry out its normal function (e.g. by processing viral RNA so it cannot be recognized by RIG-I, or by promoting the degradation of RIG-I).
comment: The reason for obsoleting this term is that it is too specific. The exact molecular roles of the individual proteins should be captured separately.

comment: Consider also annotating to 'tapasin binding ; GO:0046980'.
comment: GO:0039594 can be used to annotate a host or viral endoribonuclease activity that cleaves host mRNA in response to a viral infection.
comment: GO:0039597 should be used to annotate viral proteins which utilize a host RNase to induce endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNAs (e.g. the NSP1 protein of SARS coronavirus). For viral proteins that have endoribonuclease activity themselves, consider instead annotating to: 'endoribonuclease activity involved in viral induction of host mRNA catabolic process ; GO:0039594'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is unclear what role the viral protein is playing in this process. and there is insufficient evidence to use this term for annotation.
comment: Some viruses utilize a host RNase to induce endonucleolytic cleavage of template mRNAs (e.g. the NSP1 protein of SARS coronavirus); for these consider instead annotating to the child term 'induction by virus of host endoribonuclease activity ; GO:0039597'. Other viral proteins act as endonucleases themselves to cleave mRNA and then rely on the host degradation machinery to clear the resulting fragments (e.g. gamma herpesvirus SOX protein); for these cases consider instead annotating to the child term 'endoribonuclease activity involved in viral induction of host mRNA catabolic process ; GO:0039594'.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that the term is too specific, and the paper referenced in the term should instead be annotated to GO:0039602 ; suppression by virus of host transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter.

comment: The T=2 symmetry is an non-official appellation; strictly speaking the capsid has a T=1 symmetry with each unit composed of a homodimer.
comment: T=pseudo3 capsids are not T=3 symmetry as described by Caspar and Klug (PMID:14019094) because the basic unit is composed of three different proteins. Since the three subunits are morphologically very similar, the structure is therefore a pseudo T=3.
comment: Spherical viruses with T numbers greater than or equal to 7 are skewed. They are therefore described as either right-handed (dextro) or left-handed (laevo).
comment: Note that some gene products that possess DNA translocase activity, such as members of the FtsK/SpoIIIE family, can be fixed in place by interactions with other components of the cell; the relative movement between the protein and DNA bound to it results in movement of the DNA within the cell, often across a membrane.
comment: To annotate the region of the complete virus particle in which the viral genome is contained, instead use 'virion nucleoid ; GO:0039642'.
comment: The reason for obsoleting this term is that it is too specific. The exact molecular roles of the individual proteins should be captured separately. See also: suppression by virus of host TBK1 activity; GO:0039723, and suppression by virus of host IKBKE activity; GO:0039724.
comment: This method of entry into the cell differs between viruses; filamentous bacteriophages have rod-shaped virions which attach to the tip of the pilus; after retraction of the pilus with the virion attached, the genome can enter the host cell through the pilus basal pore. For icosahedral viruses, retraction of the pilus brings the virus in contact with the cell membrane and the genome can enter the cell via membrane fusion or genome injection. In GO, viral entry begins after viral attachment; for pilus-attachment proteins see instead: viral attachment to host cell pilus ; GO:0039666.
comment: For annotation of viral pilus-binding proteins, see also 'viral attachment to host cell pilus ; GO:0039666'.
comment: When a pore-forming protein is involved, see also 'pore-mediated entry of viral genome into host cell ; GO:0044694'.
comment: This term is intended to annotate gene products involved in the process of viral translational shunt, not viral proteins produced by this translation process.
comment: This term is intended to annotate gene products involved in the process of viral translational readthrough, not viral proteins produced by this translation process.
comment: When TBK1 acts as part of a TBK1-IKBKE-DDX3 complex, consider also annotating to: suppression by virus of host TBK1-IKBKE-DDX3 complex activity ; GO:0039659.
comment: When IKBKE acts as part of a TBK1-IKBKE-DDX3 complex, consider also annotating to: suppression by virus of host TBK1-IKBKE-DDX3 complex activity ; GO:0039659.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'protein-based cuticle' is an unnecessary grouping term.
comment: See also the biological process term 'cell growth ; GO:0016049'.
comment: Note that this term and its definition depart from the usual conventions for GO 'regulation' process terms; regulation of rate is not usually distinguished from regulation of extent or frequency, but it makes sense to do so for growth regulation.

comment: Note that this term was 'body morphogenesis (sensu Nematoda)'.
comment: Note that this term is only to be used in situations were this process occurs normally. Not to be used to describe mutant or diseased states.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is contains gene product specific characteristics.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it is too gene product specific.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a molecular function and not a biological process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents binding to an individual protein.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it is defined as a Process term, i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.
comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.
comment: Despite their naming, neuropeptide F (NPF) and short neuropeptide F (sNPF) are not closely related.
comment: Note that either or both mechanisms mentioned in the definition may be used in this process. Note that both granule release and the engagement of death receptors on target cells result in induction of apoptosis in the target cell.
comment: Note that this term is intended for cell-surface molecules on a target cell which interact with activating receptors on a natural killer cell to promote natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity.
comment: Note that 'error-free' does not mean that literally zero errors occur during DNA synthesis, but that the error rate is low, comparable to that of DNA synthesis during replication.
comment: This term was made obsolete because describing something as an 'antigen' means that an organism can produce antibodies to it, which says nothing about the gene product activity.
comment: Note that this term does not include binding to the antigen peptide bound to the MHC protein, for this also annotate to 'peptide antigen binding ; GO:0042605' or one of its children.
comment: Note that this term does not include binding to the antigen peptide bound to the MHC protein. Consider also annotating to the molecular function term 'peptide antigen binding ; GO:0042605' or one of its children.

comment: Note that placoid scales found in the cartilaginous fishes presumably develop through the same processes, but are found on the dermis, rather than in the mouth or pharynx. See Wikipedia:Placoid_scale#Placoid_scales.
comment: Note that this term refers to the mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear.
comment: Note that immunologists typically use the word 'development' to refer to cells of B or T cell lineages undergoing the process that GO describes as 'cell differentiation'.
comment: Note that bacterial lipopeptides are derived from bacterial lipoproteins, but the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: Note that although GO generally avoids the use of localization information in terms, in this case an exception was made. This is because the fact that the cleavage occurs within the membrane is integral to its function, as it is the only thing that distinguishes this group from other aspartic endopeptidases.
comment: Note that 'hydrolysis' is actually a reaction rather than a process. The synonym 'hemoglobin hydrolysis' was the text string associated with the secondary ID GO:0020029, which was retained because its definition did describe a process.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that these terms include the substrate of the reaction.
comment: Note that an immunoglobulin complex has the function of antigen binding if a suitable antigen is available.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to a cell fractionation experimental result and not a bona fide cellular component.
comment: Note that this term does not refer to the extraembryonic membrane surrounding the embryo of amniote vertebrates as this is an anatomical structure and is therefore not covered by GO.
comment: Note that this term can be used to describe the binding of a peptide to an MHC molecule.
comment: See also the cellular component term 'MHC class I peptide loading complex ; GO:0042824'.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that the there is no convincing example of a protein with this function.
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase. To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: Note that this structure is distinct from the chromoplast of plants, which is also sometimes called a chromatophore; it also should not be confused with the specialized pigment-producing cells known as chromatophores, found in fish and amphibian skin.
comment: Note that this complex is conserved in fungi but has not been observed in metazoans.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex ; GO:0000506', which represents a distinct complex with a different catalytic activity.
comment: Note that in the ecdysteroidogenic pathway, this activity catalyzes the conversion of 2,22-dideoxyecdysone (ketotriol) to 2-deoxyecdysone.

comment: This term was made obsolete because NEDD8-class tags do not target proteins for proteolytic destruction.
comment: Note that in some species, the methyl group may be added to a lysine in a slightly different position of the histone H4 protein, but that this term still applies.
comment: Note that in some species, the methyl group may be added to a lysine in a slightly different position of the histone H3 protein, but that this term still applies.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product and also refers to a non-existent activity (polo kinase).
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a biological process.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents binding to an individual protein.
comment: Bipolar cell growth refers to a change in both cell size and cell shape. For shape changes where cell size is not affected, consider instead the term 'establishment or maintenance of bipolar cell polarity resulting in cell shape ; GO:0061246' and its children.
comment: Note that although this complex is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, there is some evidence that it may also be found in the Golgi.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this term has been inconsistently used. For export of an antibiotic by the organism that synthesizes it, consider 'GO:0140115 ; export across plasma membrane'. For export of an antibiotic by the target organism, consider 'GO:1990961 ; xenobiotic detoxification by transmembrane export across the plasma membrane'.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this term has been inconsistently used. Consider annotating to 'GO:0042910 ; xenobiotic transmembrane transporter activity' and the specific solute being transported as an annotation extension.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is this term has been incorrectly used.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it represents a molecular function.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to the biosynthesis of a protein.

comment: This term was obsoleted because there is no evidence for a specific lactone transporter.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents binding to an individual protein.
comment: This term should only be used when it is not possible to determine which phase or subtype of the apoptotic process is regulated by a gene product. Whenever detailed information is available, the more granular children terms should be used.

comment: Note that 'cell body' and 'cell soma' are not used in the literature for cells that lack projections, nor for some cells (e.g. yeast with mating projections) that do have projections.
comment: Note that this term represents the return of T cell levels to stable numbers following an immune response as well as the proliferation and elimination of T cells required to maintain stable numbers in the absence of an outside stimulus.
comment: This term was made obsolete because microtubule-based flagellum (GO:0009434) and motile cilium (GO:0031514), as referenced by this term, were determined to be equivalent and merged. When a merge for this term was considered, it was noticed that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are annotated to it because its meaning had been ambiguous so obsoletion was considered safest.
comment: This term should only be used when it is not possible to determine which phase or subtype of the apoptotic process is positively regulated by a gene product. Whenever detailed information is available, the more granular children terms should be used.
comment: This term should only be used when it is not possible to determine which phase or subtype of the apoptotic process is negatively regulated by a gene product. Whenever detailed information is available, the more granular children terms should be used.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the definition was incorrect.
comment: Note that this term is intended for the annotation of prokaryotic gene products.
comment: See also the biological process term 'site-specific replication termination ; GO:0071170' and its children.
comment: Note that mammalian NT-5 was initially named differently from amphibian NT-4 because of sequence differences, but the two genes were later shown to be functionally equivalent [SF:919858].
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to biosynthesis of a protein.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it represents a substrate-specific version of the general term GO:0008559 ATPase-coupled xenobiotic transmembrane transporter activity.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: Note that unlike mammals or Drosophila, C. elegans (and many lower organisms) do not have professional macrophages/phagocytes, instead cell corpses are engulfed by neighboring cells. Cell types that can function as engulfing cells include hypodermal cells, gonadal sheath cells, pharyngeal muscle cells, and intestinal cells.
comment: The reason for obsoleting is that the term is not cleary defined, ie the membrane to which proteins are being targeted is not specified.
comment: Note that the presence of exogenous double-stranded RNA is usually indicative of a viral infection. Consider also annotating to 'response to virus ; GO:0009615'.
comment: Note that the polyprenyl sidechain substrate for these methyltransferases varies in length between species, for example, 6 units in S. cerevisiae, 8 units in E. coli and 10 units in G. suboxidans. Where the length of the substrate polyprenyl chain is unknown, the term '2-polyprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone methyltransferase activity ; GO:0008425' should be used.

comment: Note that while this enzyme uses a similar reaction chemistry to topoisomerases and site-specific recombinases, it performs a unique reaction. Topoisomerases promote breakage and reunion of either one or two DNA strands to alter the topological state of a DNA molecule. Site-specific recombinases perform a more complex reaction in which four strands are broken and subsequently joined to a different DNA duplex, resulting in the production of a recombinant product. The telomere resolvases on the other hand, must break two phosphodiester bonds in a single DNA duplex (one on each strand) and join each end with the opposite DNA strand to form covalently closed hairpin telomeres.

comment: This term was made obsolete because 'short' is not a quantitative or meaningful measurement of time.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'long' is not a quantitative or meaningful measurement of time.
comment: Note that this term also includes the exchange of sperm-specific histones or protamines with histones, occurring during spermatogenesis and fertilization.

comment: Note that this heterodimeric cytokine utilizes the IL-12p35 subunit as its alpha chain, which is also used by IL-35 as its alpha chain, and utilizes the IL-12p40 subunit as its beta chain, which is also used by IL-23 as its beta chain.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to assays rather than processes. If neuron death by apoptosis is assessed, consider using GO:0043523 regulation of neuron apoptotic process. If neuron death is assessed but the cell death modality isn't defined, refer to GO:0070997 neuron death. Where non-neuronal cells are involved, and/or processes other than cell death are described, please use other terms for annotation.
comment: Note that we use this single class to represent all 4 isoforms of this complex. We decided to do this because the isoforms do not differ in function, rather in expression and regulation. We may want to revisit this in future.
comment: See also the molecular function term 'N-acetylglucosaminyldiphosphodolichol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity ; GO:0004577'.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that the term is ambiguous. Three more clearly defined terms have been created that should be considered in its place.
comment: This term should be used to annotate gene products from the engulfing cell that facilitate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. It should not be mistaken with GO:0070782 'phosphatidylserine exposure on apoptotic cell surface', a process occurring in apoptotic cells that acts as a signal for engulfing cells. If gene products involved in such instances of phosphatidylserine exposure are shown to have a positive effect on engulfment, they may be annotated to GO:1901076 'positive regulation of engulfment of apoptotic cell'.
comment: Although most of the processes described under 'apoptotic mitochondrial changes' take place during the signaling phase of apoptosis, 'mitochondrial fragmentation involved in apoptotic process' cannot be confidently placed there. It is still controversial whether this process is involved in the signaling phase of apoptosis or not, so it was placed under the more generic 'apoptotic mitochondrial changes' parent rather than linked to the signaling or the execution phase until further research clarifies the matter.
comment: Note that the exine is highly resistant to strong acids and bases.
comment: Note that ectexine is distinguished on staining properties; compare with 'sexine ; GO:0043673'. See also 'endexine ; GO:0043671'.

comment: Note that nexine is distinguished on purely morphological criteria; compare with 'endexine ; GO:0043671'. See also 'sexine ; GO:0043673'.
comment: Note that the sexine sometimes consists of 5 layers, but of those, 3 layers are the most common (sexine 1 = columellae; sexine 2 = tectum; sexine 3 = sculpture elements). Sexine is distinguished on purely morphological criteria; compare with 'ectexine ; GO:0043669'. See also 'nexine ; GO:0043672'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was poorly named and poorly defined.
comment: Note that the intine is not acetolysis resistant and is therefore absent in conventionally prepared palynological material.
comment: Note that this process has been observed in some archaeal and bacterial species.
comment: This term should only be used to annotate a protein modification process that occurs after the start of translation but while the protein is still on the ribosome.
comment: This term should only be used to annotate a protein modification process that occurs after the protein has been released from the ribosome, and is therefore strictly post-translational. Modification of a free protein (one not attached to a ribosome) and modification of a C-terminal residue are post-translational processes. Some protein modifications occur while the protein is still in the ribosome but before translation has been completed; these modification processes are considered co-translational and should not be annotated using this term.
comment: Note that this process has been observed in some archaeal and bacterial species.
comment: Note that this term should be used to annotate gene products involved in dedifferentiation that occurs as part of a normal process, such as regeneration. It should not be used for dedifferentiation that occurs in an abnormal or disease state such as cancer.

comment: Note that this term represents an activity and not a cellular structure. Consider also annotating to the cellular structure term 'cell envelope Sec protein transport complex ; GO:0031522'. For proteins involved in bacterial type II secretion across the outer membrane, consider annotating to 'protein secretion by the type II secretion system ; GO:0015628'. For proteins involved in Sec-complex dependent translocation into the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum, consider annotating to 'SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane, translocation ; GO:0006616'.

comment: Note that 'cell body' and 'cell soma' are not used in the literature for cells that lack projections, nor for some cells (e.g. yeast with mating projections) that do have projections.
comment: This is based on the finding that L-aspartate oxidase (NadB) of E. coli preferentially uses fumarate as the electron acceptor and does so under anaerobic conditions. The same enzyme uses oxygen as the electron acceptor under aerobic conditions. The EC conflates the two reactions in EC:1.4.3.16 (as they are catalyzed by the same enzyme).
comment: Note that as agreed during the transcription overhaul, terms specifying binding to specific transcription regulatory motifs are no longer being created. The level of specificity GO has decided to go to is the "core promoter", "core promoter proximal region" and "enhancer". To capture more detail, please consider using column 16.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that all proteins are imported into the nucleus via the same mechanism, so the import of individual proteins should be captured with extensions or by GO-CAM models.

comment: This term was obsoleted because the cell type should be captured as an annotation extension.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is ambiguous.
comment: This reaction is achieved by the catalysis of two successive steps carried out by the same enzyme - the transfer of a methyl group from the substrate to the cobalt cofactor of a methylated-thiol-specific corrinoid protein (MtsB), and the subsequent transfer of the methyl group from the corrinoid protein to coenzyme M. With most other methanogenesis substrates this process is carried out by two different enzymes (for example, EC:2.1.1.90, methanol-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase, and EC:2.1.1.246, methylated methanol-specific corrinoid protein:coenzyme M methyltransferase). The cobalt is oxidized during methylation from the Co(I) state to the Co(III) state, and is reduced back to the Co(I) form during demethylation.
comment: This mechanism is used by animal viruses such as poliovirus. Various tailed bacteriophages also carry specialized proteins which open a pore or a channel in the host membrane(s) to allow genome delivery into host cytoplasm.
comment: Note that this process occurs after the cell division partitioning event.
comment: This term was made obsolete because we decided that all responses are single-organism.
comment: Note that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
comment: Note that we deem cilium and microtubule-based flagellum to be equivalent.
comment: This reaction may serve to remove heterogeneous extra bases from the viral DNA end, and to stabilize the integrase-DNA complex. The chemistry of cleavage is a simple hydrolysis by single-step transesterification.
comment: Note that terminally differentiated cells in higher eukaryotes are typically quiescent but metabolically active. Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during). Also, note that this term should not be used for direct annotation.

comment: Example annotations to this term include the S. cerevisiae alpha1,2-mannosyltransferases ScKre2p, ScKtr1p and ScKtr3pof the KTR family.
comment: Note that phases are is_a disjoint from other biological processes. happens_during relationships can operate between phases and other biological processes e.g. DNA replication happens_during S phase.

comment: This term was made obsolete because it was defined ambiguously, and has therefore been used incorrectly in annotations. To update annotations of gene products that act as receptors for MHC class II protein complexes, use the molecular function term 'MHC class II receptor activity ; GO:0032395'; to update annotations of gene products which are components of MHC class II protein complexes, use the cellular component term 'MHC class II protein complex ; GO:0042613'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'error-prone' does not correspond to a repair mechanism, and the term has been superseded by more specific terms.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'error-free' does not correspond to a repair mechanism, and the term has been superseded by more specific terms.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.
comment: Note that 'vectorial' is used in the definition in the mathematical and physical sense of pertaining to 'a quantity having direction as well as magnitude, especially as determining the position of one point in space relative to another.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the definition was incorrect. Not all neuroblasts divide asymmetrically. Neuroblasts give rise to neurons after division.
comment: This term was made obsolete because there is no 'conservative' process of protein import into the mitochondrial intermembrane space that is distinct from the more general parent; furthermore, 'conservative' is used in the literature to describe a pathway of import into the inner membrane rather than into the intermembrane space.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it artificially groups a number of other terms, leading to path problems, its definition is unclear (and lacks genus-differentia features), and it has probably been used incorrectly in annotations.

comment: Note that currently, the only known substrates of neddylation are cullin family proteins.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'sensitivity/resistance' implies a phenotype rather than a biological process.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it was not clearly defined, it has no corresponding EC or RHEA.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product rather than a molecular function.
comment: Note that this term was 'cell fate determination' but the term name was changed to better match its existing definition and the child term 'cell fate determination; GO:0001709' was also created.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it represent translation of a gene product, not a specific process.
comment: Note that IgM and IgD can be coexpressed by B cells via an alternate splicing mechanism, but true recombinational isotype switching to IgD has been demonstrated as well. Note that this term is best used to annotate gene products which are involved in the mechanism of DNA recombination used in isotype switching, like the B cell specific Swap70 factor in the mouse, rather than gene products which promote isotype switching such as cytokines or co-stimulatory molecules, which should instead be annotated to 'regulation of isotype switching ; GO:0045191'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because low-density lipoprotein is a macromolecular complex, not a single class of molecule; its degradation involves the dissociation of non-covalently attached constituents as well as some breaking and reforming of covalent bonds.

comment: The reason for obsoletion is that those represent specific gene products, and genes annotated to those terms should be annotated to 'regulation of gene expression' or 'regulation of transcription' or some signaling term.
comment: This term was made obsolete because the receptor is defined based on its cellular expression pattern, and the definition is inaccurate: receptors on natural killer cells can either activate or inhibit natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

comment: This term was made obsolete because microtubule-based flagellum (GO:0009434) and motile cilium (GO:0031514), as referenced by this term, were determined to be equivalent and merged. When a merge for this term was considered, it was noticed that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are annotated to it because its meaning had been ambiguous so obsoletion was considered safest.
comment: Note that this term can be used in place of the obsolete terms 'storage protein ; GO:0005187' and 'storage protein of fat body (sensu Insecta) ; GO:0008041'.
comment: This term was made obsolete as part of the cell cycle overhaul. This is because it was decided that cell cycle phases are intervals and so cannot be regulated, rather it is the transitions between the phases that are regulated.

comment: Note that this term and its definition depart from the usual conventions for GO 'regulation' process terms; regulation of rate is not usually distinguished from regulation of extent or frequency, but it makes sense to do so for growth regulation.

comment: Note that this term should not be used to refer to CD14 alone, but the multiprotein receptor complex that it is part of.
comment: Viral attachment to the host cell is not part of viral entry in GO because virus attachment does not always lead to viral entry: attachment can also result in the virion being carried by the host cell to another location.

comment: This term was made obsolete because the meaning of the term is unclear. It most likely refers to inhibiting the process by which a virus particle is neutralized by the host cell in a complement-dependent manner.
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'virulence' is not a biological process; however, alteration of virulence also does not fit under 'regulation of biological quality ; GO:0065008' because it is a product both of the genotype/phenotype of the infecting organism and the genotype/phenotype of the organism being infected and varies by individual within a species both for the infecting organism and the infected organism.

comment: Note that the name 'para-aminobenzoic acid synthase' was initially given to the 'aminodeoxychorismate synthase' activity before the additional 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase activity was discovered. It is the lyase activity that actually produces para-aminobenzoic acid from 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is a grouping term representing two quite different sets of entities, hexose sugars and glycerophospholipids.
comment: See also the molecular function term 'ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase activity ; GO:0016984'.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it represents a reaction intermediate, not a biological process, see PMID:9148748.
comment: Note that this should not be confused with 'geranylgeranyl-diphosphate geranylgeranyltransferase activity ; GO:0016767', EC:2.5.1.32. This activity is the second part of the formation of phytoene from geranylgeranyl-diphosphate, the first stage of which is catalyzed by EC:2.5.1.32.
comment: This term was made obsolete because a more appropriate term was created.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this term was incorrectly named, defined, and placed in the ontology, and thus had been used to annotate two unrelated processes of [intermembrane lipid transfer] and processes related to [vesicular transport]. It was also inappropriately used as the parent term for [protein transport from ciliary membrane to plasma membrane], which has already been moved to an appropriate location as a child of [protein transport within lipid bilayer].

comment: Note that the enzyme alcohol oxidase also has methanol oxidase activity (GO:0046563).
comment: This activity produces the R-enantiomer of HPETE, 8(R)-HPETE. For the reaction producing the S-enantiomer, see GO:0036403.

comment: This term is slated for obsoletion. RHEA indicates the activity has been shown not to exist.
comment: In GO, a gene product with 'vascular endothelial growth factor-activated receptor activity ; GO:0005021' necessarily binds VEGF to transduce a signal. In contrast, the VEGFR refers to PR:000001971. To represent cross-talk between ligands and receptors, signaling pathways in GO are starting to be named after the receptor and/or the signal. GO:0048010 is for annotation of any pathway in which a ligand (VEGF or an alternative growth factor) binds and activates a VEGFR (PR:000001971). For annotation of signaling pathways where a VEGF binds to a cell surface receptor (VEGFR, PDGFR etc.), consider 'vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway ; GO:0038084'.
comment: 1. Making inferences in GO about compounds based on the cofactor role curated by ChEBI creates relationships that are not always true which violates ontological principles for GO; therefore we will cease making these inferences. 2. It is not meaningful to group binding interactions that are not all chemically related by the fact that they may be used as a cofactor.
comment: Note that this process is the opposite of chromatin silencing. This regulation is exemplified by members of the trithorax group, which maintain the active state of homeotic gene transcription.
comment: Note that this process is the opposite of gene silencing.
comment: The precise nature of autophagic cell death is still being debated, and the link between autophagy and cell death unclear. As autophagy is often induced under conditions of stress that could also lead to cell death, there has been a propagation of the idea that autophagy can act as a cell death mechanism; but others suggest that autophagy may simply be an attempt of dying cells to adapt to lethal stress rather than a mechanism to execute a cell death program. Further studies are required to resolve this controversy (see e.g. PMID:22082964, PMID:22052193, PMID:25236395). In the meantime, curators should carefully examine the experimental evidence presented in papers concerning autophagic cell death, and annotate accordingly. Recently, an instance of autophagic cell death, termed autosis, was discovered that relies on the plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase. Autosis was observed in vivo in the brain of rats subjected to an ischemic insult. It's still unclear if all cases of autophagic cell death require the Na+/K+-ATPase or not.
comment: Note that this is a generic parent because the identity of the second amino acid is not critical for formation of the cross-link.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is an unnecessary grouping term and was poorly defined.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that those represent specific gene products, and genes annotated to those terms should be annotated to 'regulation of gene expression' or 'regulation of transcription' or some signaling term.

comment: Note that this term does not have 'extracellular region ; GO:0005576' as a parent because in plants the extracellular matrix is considered part of the cell.
comment: Note that GTP-binding Rab proteins serve as regulators of vesicle targeting and fusion.
comment: This term was made obsolete because its definition is very similar to that of its parent term, actin cortical patch localization (GO:0051666), but somewhat unclear, and not similar enough to merge the terms.
comment: Avian spermatozoa do not require a period of capacitation, since they are competent to fertilize the egg without a prolonged sojourn in the oviduct or in a capacitation medium in vitro. Therefore, sperm capacitation can only be applied to Aves to refer to gene products involved in processes that occur prior to sperm being deposited from the avian male. The term cannot apply to processes occurring in the avian female reproductive tract.
comment: See also the molecular function term 'methionine adenosyltransferase activity ; GO:0004478'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it violates the principle of positivity.
comment: Note that this term is to be used only for gene products involved in the expression of IgD through recombinational switching into the vestigial switch region at the 5' end of the IgD gene segment, rather than gene products involved in the expression of IgD through alternative splicing mechanisms.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it was not clearly defined.
comment: Consider instead annotating to one of the more specific child terms, or to 'floral organ development ; GO:0048438' or one of its child terms.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with the cellular component term 'nuclear membrane lumen ; GO:0005641', which has the synonym 'perinuclear space'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it has been widely, and incorrectly, used to annotate proteins that have GPI anchors covalently attached. A new term has been created that can be used to annotate gene products that interact non-covalently with GPI anchors.
comment: This term was made obsolete because more appropriate terms were created.

comment: This process was made obsolete because we felt it not provide a particularly useful classification, and its very broad logical definition caused regular problems in our inference pipelines.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was ambiguously defined and incorrectly placed in the ontology.
comment: Note that, for example, the formation of a pseudopod in an amoeba would not be considered formation involved in morphogenesis because it would not be thought of as the formation of an anatomical structure that was part of the shaping of the amoeba during its development. The formation of an axon from a neuron would be considered the formation of an anatomical structure involved in morphogenesis because it contributes to the creation of the form of the neuron in a developmental sense.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was an unnecessary grouping term. Striated muscle comprises skeletal and cardiac muscle, but GO has opted not to group the muscle fiber development terms.
comment: This term was made obsolete because smooth muscle does not have fibers.
comment: Note that this function was formerly EC:1.4.4.1.

comment: Note that this function was formerly EC:4.2.1.71.
comment: Note that EC:4.4.1.12 was deleted from EC as the reaction is performed by sulfoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase (EC:2.3.3.15).
comment: Take care to annotate to the reaction, not simply by enzyme name. Note that the name "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" (listed as a synonym here) has variously been used to refer to two distinctly different enzymes. Both enzymes act on ureidoglycolate and produce glyoxylate, but the mechanism and reaction products are different. The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" listed in the Enzyme commission (EC) is a ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase, releasing ammonia, (EC:3.5.3.19 ; GO:0004848). The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" characterized in PMID:3915539 (published prior to the EC designation of EC:3.5.3.19) is a ureidoglycolate lyase, releasing urea (EC:4.3.2.3 ; GO:0050385). The inappropriate labelling of ureidoglycolate lyase as EC:3.5.3.19 has caused much confusion in the literature (see PMID:24107613). Take care to correctly annotate based on the reaction products, rather than name.

comment: This term is slated for obsoletion;  According to RHEA the activity does not exist.
comment: This term should be used to annotate release of arachidonic acid from the cell. For the hydrolytic release of arachidonic acid from a phospholipid, consider instead annotating to 'phospholipase A2 activity ; GO:0004623'.
comment: Note that the enzyme sulfoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase also has sulfoacetaldehyde lyase activity (GO:0050312).
comment: Note that EC classifies 'UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-2,6-diaminopimelyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine-diphosphoundecaprenol 4-beta-N-acetylglucosaminlytransferase activity ; GO:0051991' and 'undecaprenyldiphospho-muramoylpentapeptide beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity ; GO:0050511' under the same EC number, EC:2.4.1.227.
comment: This term was made obsolete because this activity is currently defined as catalyzing two sequential reactions based on a gene product. However, "inositol polyphosphate multikinase activity" in some organisms can catalyze additional reactions. In addition, the reactions listed in the definition can be catalyzed independently by other gene products.
comment: Note that this was EC:2.7.1.152. This term was made obsolete because this activity is currently defined as catalyzing two reactions based on a gene product. The reactions listed in the definition can be catalyzed independently by other gene products.

It is not meaningful to group binding interactions that are not all chemically related by the fact that they may be used as a coenzyme.
comment: This term was made obsolete because no known receptor binds apolipoprotein E; instead, receptors bind holo-lipoprotein E (apolipoprotein E + bound lipid).
comment: Note that this term refers to the proliferation of previously activated T cells; it is to be used for gene products involved in T cell proliferation following an antigenic stimulus, including both proteins internal to the T cell and external factors, such as IL-2, which specifically promote proliferation of activated T cells.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents both process and function information.
comment: This term was obsoleted because water binding is non-specific.
comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.
comment: Note that the term diapedesis, although sometimes used as a direct synonym for cellular extravasation, is used here for the specific final step of the process, in concordance with recent reviews of the topic.
comment: Note that the chromatophore mentioned here is distinct from the pigment bearing structure found in certain photosynthetic bacteria and cyanobacteria. It is also different from the plant chromoplast, which is also sometimes called a chromatophore.

comment: Note that this term differs from 'cell pole ; GO:0060187' in that it is applicable to the thin ends of elongated cells, such as the ends of axons or dendrites.
comment: Note that this term differs from 'cytokinesis ; GO:0000910' in that cytokinesis does not include nuclear division.
comment: This class covers transient, lateral attachment to microtubules as well as stable, correctly oriented, end-on attachment (biorientation)
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this term does not provide a useful distinction from its parent, GO:0052704 (because that trimethyl-His yada is present in both pathways)
comment: Class II AP endonuclease is a nuclease, but not Class I, III and IV.
comment: In this reaction N,N'-diacetylchitobiose is deacetylated at the non-reducing residue to produce 2-acetamido-4-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-2-deoxy-D-glucose (GlcN-GlcNAc). This is in contrast to EC:3.5.1.105 in which N,N'-diacetylchitobiose is deacetylated at the reducing residue to produce 4-O-(N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl)-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc-GlcN). For the latter reaction, see GO:0036311.
comment: EC has determined that this reaction in fact does not exist and have withdrawn EC:1.3.3.1. Note: If fumarate is not shown to be involved, you may want to consider GO:0004152, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity (parent term); if the reaction involves fumarate, then use GO:0052888 dihydroorotate oxidase (fumarate) activity.

comment: Transmembrane transport is the transport of a solute across a lipid bilayer. Note that transport through the nuclear pore complex is not transmembrane because the nuclear membrane is a double membrane and is not traversed. For transport through the nuclear pore, consider instead the term 'nucleocytoplasmic transport ; GO:0006913' and its children. Note also that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to a non-existent molecular function term, 'glycerophosphate activity', which also cannot be found in the literature.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it represents a molecular function.

comment: The reason for obsoletion is that based on the definition, it is not clear that this process exists.
comment: Note that cilia and eukaryotic flagella are deemed to be equivalent.
comment: Note that this term represents an activity and not a gene product, and should only be used when the receptor binds the ligand BDNF. For receptors that bind other growth factors, consider annotating to other terms under 'transmembrane signaling receptor activity ; GO:0004888.
comment: Note that this term differs from 'cell tip ; GO:0051286' in that it is applicable to a broad range of cell shapes including spherical and cuboidal.
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase. To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: Note that we deem cilium and microtubule-based flagellum to be equivalent.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is unclear exactly what it means. It could mean either 'regulation of transcription during phase X' or 'regulation of transition between phase X and phase Y'.
comment: Note that we deem eukaryotic cilia and microtubule-based flagella to be equivalent.
comment: This term was made obsolete because microtubule-based flagellum (GO:0009434) and motile cilium (GO:0031514), as referenced by this term, were determined to be equivalent and merged. When a merge for this term was considered, it was noticed that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are annotated to it because its meaning had been ambiguous so obsoletion was considered safest.

comment: The reason for obsoletion is that there is no evidence that this is a different process from its parent term (DNA replication initiation, GO:0006270), but only that regulation of initiation at late origins differs from regulation of initiation at early origins.
comment: This term was made obsolete because there is no evidence that this function exists. There are no known type II topoisomerase enzymes that are ATP-independent; as far as we know, ALL type II topoisomerase enzymes utilize hydrolysis of ATP.
comment: Note that we deem cilium and microtubule-based flagellum to be equivalent.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents two distinct molecular functions.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is thought to be an experimental artefact.
comment: This enzyme catalyzes a transferase reaction.
comment: An example of this complex is PhnI (P16687) in Escherichia coli.
comment: This reaction is the removal of a glutaryl group from a glutarylated lysine residue of a protein or peptide.
comment: This term was obsoleted because there is no evidence that this reaction occurs under physiological conditions.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that the term captures the structure of a complex, not a specific function.

comment: The reason for obsoletion is that helicases only and always use ATP (although under very specific experimental conditions GTP can perhaps be used; this is not the case in vivo), therefore this term was an unnecessary grouping term.

comment: Note that while typically associated with tRNA splicing, splicing via endonucleolytic cleavages and subsequent ligation of the free exon ends is known to be used for some non-tRNA substrates, e.g. HAC1 (YFL031W) in S. cerevisiae and an intron in the 23S rRNA of the Archaeal species Desulfurococcus mobilis.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this process represents a single step (molecular function)  of the IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response (GO:0036498).
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was inaccurate.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it represents two reactions, and should be two separate terms.
comment: Note that this function was formerly EC:4.1.3.18.
comment: Note that the gene/protein name 'APC' should not be confused with the abbreviation for 'anaphase promoting complex'.

comment: Note that the word necrosis has been widely used in earlier literature to describe forms of cell death which are now known by more precise terms, such as apoptosis. Necrosis can occur in a regulated fashion, involving a precise sequence of signals; in this case, consider annotating to GO:0097300 'programmed necrotic cell death' or to its more specific child GO:0070266 'necroptotic process'.
comment: Examples of this are Birc2 and Birc3 (UniProt symbols Q62210 and O08863) in PMID:21052097.
comment: Note that oncosis is sometimes described as a type of cell death, but recent nomenclature recommendations define it as a feature of necrotic cell death rather than a distinct mode of cell death.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it does not refer to a true process, but rather to the consequences of aberrations occurred during mitosis.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that 'biogenesis' as related to a protein is translation, and there is no indication that the members of these complexes are synthesized in a particular way. Historically biogenesis terms were created for some processes when the level of a molecule was changed by an unknown mechanism, for instance transcription, translation, assembly etc. This is now considered too indirect for annotation.
comment: Note that process and function information are included in the term and definition for the purpose of describing and distinguishing the complex.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it was redundant with GO:1903832 ; regulation of cellular response to amino acid starvation.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it was redundant with GO:1903574 ; negative regulation of cellular response to amino acid starvation.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it was redundant with GO:1903833 ; positive regulation of cellular response to amino acid starvation.
comment: Note that this MAPKKK cascade is commonly referred to as the ERK pathway in the literature, but involves only ERK1 or ERK2 and should not be confused with cascades that involve other ERK kinases.
comment: Note that the Harderian gland is found in all terrestrial vertebrate groups, including amphibia, reptiles, birds, and mammals. However, it appears to be absent in certain mammals such as bats, cows, horses, and higher primates. Though largely absent in the adult human, it is present in the fetal and neonatal stages.
comment: See also the cellular component term 'heterotrimeric G-protein complex ; GO:0005834'.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes a complex with a drug bound, with the drug being exogenous to the species where the experiment takes place and where that interaction would never occur naturally.
comment: See also the cellular component term 'heterotrimeric G-protein complex ; GO:0005834'.
comment: Note that this term represents one of two reactions that are grouped together in EC:2.1.1.267.
comment: See also the cellular component terms 'cyclin-dependent protein kinase activating kinase holoenzyme complex ; GO:0019907' and 'DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, holoenzyme ; GO:0016591'.
comment: For binding to the death effector domain, consider instead the term 'death effector domain binding ; GO:0035877'.
comment: Note that process and function information are included in the term and definition for the purpose of describing and distinguishing the complex.
comment: Note that this term can be used in place of the obsolete cellular component term 'telomere ; GO:0005696'. Use with caution because this term refers to a specific protein complex and not a region of the chromosome.
comment: Note that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
comment: Note that this term is intended for annotation of gene products involved in mitochondrial shape changes associated with development; an example is the morphogenesis of the Nebenkern during spermatogenesis.
comment: Note that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
comment: Note that as agreed during the transcription overhaul, terms specifying binding to specific transcription regulatory motifs are no longer being created. The level of specificity GO has decided to go to is the "core promoter", "core promoter proximal region" and "enhancer". To capture more detail, please consider using column 16.

comment: This term was made obsolete because there is no evidence for the existence of this complex.
comment: Note that the gene/protein name 'APC' should not be confused with the abbreviation for 'anaphase promoting complex'.
comment: Note that this heterodimeric cytokine utilizes the same beta subunit as IL-12.
comment: Note that this heterodimeric cytokine utilizes the same EBI3 subunit (product of EBI3, Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 3) as its beta chain as IL-35 uses for its beta chain. Also note that the product of the IL27 gene is the alpha subunit of IL-27. The functional IL-27 protein complex requires both subunits.
comment: Note that this heterodimeric cytokine utilizes the same IL-12p35 subunit as its alpha chain as IL-12 uses and the same EBI3 subunit (product of EBI3, Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 3) as its beta chain as IL-27 uses. IL-35 requires both subunits -- there is no separate IL35 gene.
comment: In normal cells, phosphatidylserine residues are found exclusively on the inner side of the cellular membrane. During apoptosis, phosphatidylserine is transported to the outer cell surface by scramblase proteins. This event acts as an "eat-me" signal for macrophages to dispose of the dying cell. When annotating to this term, curators should be aware of the following: 1) phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface can occur in circumstances other than apoptosis (for example, when blood platelets are activated, they expose phosphatidylserine to trigger the clotting system, see PMID:21107324). Do not annotate to GO:0070782 unless phosphatidylserine exposure is shown to be part of an apoptotic event. 2) Caution should be applied when a study quotes annexin V assays. The annexin A5 protein binds to phosphatidylserine-containing membrane surfaces, which are usually only present on the inner leaflet of the membrane. However, in cells undergoing apoptosis, phosphatidylserine becomes exposed on the outer leaflet of the membrane. A positive annexin assay can therefore be linked to apoptotic death, but it shouldn't be confused with molecular events strictly involved in the process of phosphatidylserine exposure.
comment: Note that this term has no relationship to 'membrane assembly ; GO:0071709' because the basement membrane is not a lipid bilayer.
comment: Note that, although this complex can be considered analogous to the mammalian transcription factor SL complex, the core factor complex does not include TBP, whereas SL1 does.
comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.

comment: See also the molecular function term 'histone acetyltransferase activity ; GO:0004402'.
comment: Note that this term is not a child of 'co-translational protein modification process ; GO:0043686' because co-translational protein modification implies modification of a previously incorporated amino acid in a nascent chain, rather than addition of new sequence to the C-terminus.
comment: See also the molecular function term 'alkyl hydroperoxide reductase activity ; GO:0008785'.
comment: See also the molecular function term 'acetolactate synthase activity ; GO:0003984'.
comment: Note that 'error-free' does not mean that literally zero errors occur during DNA synthesis, but that the error rate is low, comparable to that of DNA synthesis during replication.
comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation. The only exception should be when experimental data (e.g., staining with trypan blue or propidium iodide or use of neuron-specific markers) show that neuron death has occurred, but fail to provide details on death modality (accidental versus programmed). When information is provided on the neuron death mechanism, annotations should be made to the appropriate descendant of 'cell death' (such as, but not limited to, GO:0097300 'programmed necrotic cell death' or GO:0006915 'apoptotic process'), and the cell type captured as an annotation extension; or the term GO:0051402 'neuron apoptotic process' may be considered, if appropriate.
comment: Note that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that all proteins are imported into the nucleus via the same mechanism, so the import of individual proteins should be captured with extensions or by GO-CAM models.
comment: See also the biological process term 'replication fork arrest ; GO:0043111' and its children.
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct manual annotation as it should always be possible to specify the type of spindle assembly checkpoint (mitotic or meiotic).
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct manual annotation as it should always be possible to specify the type of spindle checkpoint (assembly, orientation or Dma1-dependent).

comment: This term should be used to describe a response to a specific acid as a chemical. E.g., if a cell were responding to glutamate, then the response would be glutamate-specific; the cell is actually responding to the chemical structure of the anion portion of the dissociated acid. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC. If annotating experiments where an acid is playing a role as a proton donor, please annotate to GO:0071468 'cellular response to acidic pH' instead.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it does not describe a wild-type or normal process.
comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct manual annotation of gene products. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.

comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'cellular response to hypoxia ; GO:0071456'.
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'cellular response to anoxia ; GO:0071454'. Note that in laboratory studies, hypoxia is typically studied at O2 concentrations ranging from 0.1 - 5%.
comment: This term should be used to annotate instances where a cell is responding to a chemical that is playing the role of an acid (e.g. proton donor) and therefore lowering the pH.

comment: Note that immunologists typically use the word 'development' to refer to cells of B or T cell lineages undergoing the process that GO describes as 'cell differentiation'.
comment: Note that this activity is usually associated in vivo with an NADPH-dependent disulfide reductase activity, so that catalysis of the reduction of peroxynitrite to nitrite involves the possible creation of oxygen or water, using NADPH as reduction equivalent.
comment: Note that this complex used to be thought to be involved in ER-mitochondrial membrane tethering, which is required to facilitate lipid transfer from the ER to the mitochondrial membrane, but newer findings show that this was incorrect.
comment: These processes continue to 60 DPA in Gossypium spp.

comment: This term was obsoleted because biogenesis should only be used for complexes where synthesis of some non-protein component is necessary for assembly.
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase. To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: Note that basidiospores and basidia are separate biological structures. The basidium is the structure that bear the basidiospores, but the development of the basidium is a different process than the formation of the basidiospores themselves. For this reason, GO:0034295 basidiospore formation and GO:0075313 basidium development are different terms and are not linked.
comment: Note that ascospores and asci are separate biological structures. The ascus is the structure that contain the ascospores, but the development of the ascus is a different process than the formation of the ascospores themselves; for instance, some mutations affect sporulation without affecting ascus development. For this reason, GO:0030437 ascospore formation and GO:0075317 ascus development are different terms and are not linked.

comment: This mechanism is used by viruses such as Hepadnaviridae whose capsids enter the NPC but are too big to pass intact into the nucleus.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it doesn't represent a genuine process. The term injection is mostly used for prokaryotic viruses where there is no endocytosis.

comment: In Field and Osbourn 2008 (PMID:18356490), thalianol is referred to as (3S,13S,3R)-malabarica-8,17,21-trien-3-ol and thalian-diol is referred to as (3S,13S,14R)-malabarica-8,17,21-trien-3,?-diol, but the error in this naming system was pointed out in Kolesnikova 2007 (PMID:17474751).

comment: Occurs in vascular plants, including gymnosperms and most dicotyledons. Commonly supplemented by activity of the cork cambium or phellogen (PO:0005599). Monocotyledons do not have secondary growth, but may undergo primary thickening (GO:0080192) or secondary thickening (GO:0080191), which can give the appearance of secondary growth. Primary and secondary growth can occur simultaneously in the same organism.

comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that 'biogenesis' as related to a protein is translation, and there is no indication that the members of these complexes are synthesized in a particular way. Historically biogenesis terms were created for some processes when the level of a molecule was changed by an unknown mechanism, for instance transcription, translation, assembly etc. This is now considered too indirect for annotation.
comment: Note that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
comment: Includes senescence of petals, sepals, anthers, and any other plant organ that is part of a flower. Floral organ senescence may follow pollination. In some flowers, the organs of the corolla abscise before they senesce.
comment: Has its inception in the apical meristems (PO:0020144) and continues in their derivative meristems - protoderm (PO:0006210) and procambium (PO:0025275) - even in older tissues. Primary and secondary growth can occur simultaneously in the same organism.
comment: Includes thickening of plant axes (PO:0025004) due to the activity of a cambium (PO:0005597), known as secondary growth and found in most gymnosperms and dicotyledons, a primary thickening meristem (PO:0005039) as found in many monocotyledons, some ferns and some cycads, or secondary thickening meristem, (PO:0025414) as found in some monocotyledons.
comment: Occurs in shoot axes in some monocotyledons such as Dracaena, and rarely in roots of monocotyledons. Distinct from primary thickening, because it is distant from and generally discontinuous with the apical meristem.
comment: Occurs in shoot axes and rarely in roots in many monocotyledons.
comment: Occurs in the stems (PO:0009047) of some Arecaceae (palms).

comment: Although Beta1-adrenergic receptors couple exclusively to the Gs protein, Beta2-adrenergic receptors couple to both Gs and Gi proteins. Coupling to Gi proteins may localize the Gs-mediated signaling.
comment: This activity is distinct from 'tRNA (adenine-N6-)-methyltransferase activity' (GO:0016430) in that it requires the presence of a threonylcarbamoyl modification.
comment: This term was made obsolete as part of the cell cycle overhaul. This is because it was decided that cell cycle phases are intervals and so cannot be regulated, rather it is the transitions between the phases that are regulated.

comment: At the time of obsoletion, under "regulation of molecular function", a term exists for "regulation of sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor activity" and the positive and negative child terms, but no more detailed terms exist. In reannotating, please consider if the paper would support annotation to a regulation term for a specific RNA polymerase. Also consider if what you need would be regulation of protein binding transcription factor activity or any of its child terms instead. If so, please consider making a SF item regarding creation of such a term.

comment: This term was obsoleted because it represents a molecular function.
comment: The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is a central event in the signaling phase of the apoptotic process, and it is often used by researchers to monitor this type of cell death. Any event that induces apoptosis will at some point induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Therefore, this term should only be used to annotate gene products that directly regulate this process.

comment: The reason for obsoletion is was not clearly defined. There is nothing in the literature that mentions this process; there are papers that mention viral proteins overcoming premature senescence, for example, PMID:22326283.
comment: Unicellular trichome (PO:0025537) is a trichome(PO:0000282) that is a single plant cell (PO:0009002). For a cell that forms a branch of a multicellular trichome, see multicellular trichome branch cell (PO:0025163).
comment: Carries the male gametes to into or near the ovule. May be branched in gymnosperms. This term replaces the obsolete term PO:0006345. Part of pollen tube cell (PO:0025195).
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is unclear exactly what it means. It could mean either 'regulation of transcription during phase X' or 'regulation of transition between phase X and phase Y'.
comment: Note that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.

comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this term represents a phenotype, and could be captured by other terms such as GO:0007059 chromosome segregation or GO:1903467 negative regulation of mitotic DNA replication initiation.
comment: Note that while this reaction occurs on a modified protein (acyl-carrier protein), the ACP only acts as a carrier that later releases the end product.
comment: This pathway occurs in most vertebrates, although not in guinea pigs and primates, including humans.
comment: Nomenclature note. Flippases and floppases are ATP-dependent transbilayer lipid translocators. According to an extensively used, though not universal, nomenclature, they catalyze lipid transfer towards the inward monolayer (flippases) or towards the outward monolayer (floppases). Scramblases are ATP-independent, non-selective, inducing non-specific transbilayer movements across the membrane. The direction of the translocation should be taken into account for annotation (from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic leaftlet of a membrane).
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is too fine-grained for GO. Consider Complex Portal EBI-1252490, Anaphase-Promoting Complex variant 2 as an alternate term.
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is too fine-grained for GO.
comment: Microsporidian biology uses the term endospore differently than GO:0043593 endospore coat which is for a spore formed inside of another cell. Microsporidian endospore refers to the inner layer of the spore wall itself.
comment: An example is the Dictyostelium multi protein pspB complex, which is secreted from prespore vesicles and incorporated into the spore coat.

comment: Part of trichome cell (PO:0008030).
comment: An example is Tenascin-N (Q9UQP3) in PMID:17909022 (IDA).
comment: Note that we deem cilium and microtubule-based flagellum to be equivalent. Also, researchers consider the composition of both the plasm and the membrane of the cilium to be detectably different from that in the non-ciliary cytosol and plasma membrane (e.g. in terms of calcium ion concentration, membrane lipid composition, and more). For this reason, the term "ciliary plasm" is not linked to "cytoplasm".
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that this term describes a cellular component that does not exist.
comment: Note that dendrites of dendritic cells should not be confused with neuronal cell dendrites, which process electrical signals.
comment: Note that immunologists typically use the word 'maturation' to refer to dendritic cells undergoing the process that GO describes as 'cell differentiation'.

comment: Note that 'presynaptic membrane' in this term should not be mistaken with 'presynaptic active zone'. The latter encompasses more than the former, as it also includes the specialized cortical cytoskeletal matrix in the cell cortex of a presynaptic neuron.

comment: This term can be used to annotate gene products involved in apoptotic events happening downstream of the cross-talk point between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The cross-talk starts when caspase-8 cleaves Bid and truncated Bid interacts with mitochondria. From this point on it is not possible to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.
comment: Fas acts as a death receptor with a role in apoptosis, but can also act as a non-apoptotic signal transducer.
comment: For dependence receptors, absence of a ligand or withdrawal of a ligand from a receptor acts as a signal. An example of 'extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in absence of ligand' is withdrawal of a growth factor such as NGF, even if traditionally apoptosis induced via growth factor withdrawal has been classified as an instance of intrinsic apoptosis. See an example in PMID:19767770. Ligands whose withdrawal or absence induce apoptosis should be annotated to GO:2001239 'regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in absence of ligand', rather than to the pathway term itself. Examples of gene products that may be annotated to GO:0097192 'extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in absence of ligand' include dependence receptors such as DCC or UNC5B, which relay lethal signals in the absence of their ligand (netrin-1). In the case of DCC and UNC5B, the signaling proceeds through the assembly of a DRAL- and TUCAN- (or NLRP1-) containing caspase-9-activating complex or by the dephosphorylation-mediated activation of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) by UNC5B-bound protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), respectively. DAPK1 can mediate the direct activation of executioner caspases or favor MOMP (reviewed in PMID:21760595). Also see PMID:21172653 (annotations to UNC5B and PR65beta, UniProt symbols O08722, PPP2R1B and P30154).
comment: The signals that start intrinsic apoptosis may come from extracellular sources (e.g. oxidative stress, UV exposure), but the reception of the signal and thus the signaling pathway start inside the cell (as a result of DNA damage, redox imbalance, etc.). Examples are ZPR9 (ZNF622) and ASK1 (MAP3K5) (UniProt symbols Q969S3 and Q99683) in PMID:21771788. A diagram of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway including examples of molecular players can be found in Figure 2 in PMID:21760595.
comment: Examples of gene products that may be annotated to this term include CASP2, CASP8, CASP9, and CASP10, also called initiator (or apical, or activator) caspases.
comment: Examples of gene products that may be annotated to this term include CASP3, CASP6 and CASP7, also called effector (or executioner) caspases.
comment: This term should be used to annotate gene products within the context of cellular processes other than apoptotic cell death (e.g., cell cycle arrest). To annotate gene products involved in activation of cysteine-type endopeptidases where the activation results in apoptotic process, please use the more granular term GO:0006919.
comment: Bud dormancy may precede dormancy of the whole plant.
comment: Part of a sieve element (PO:0025406).
comment: Typical of angiosperms. Part of sieve tube member (PO:0000289).
comment: Often located on an end wall of a sieve tube member. Unspecialized sieve areas may occur on other parts of the cell.

comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it represents a GO-CAM model.

comment: This enzymatic activity is usually negligible, but may become prominent when phenylalanine levels are abnormally high as in the human disease phenylketonuria (PKU).
comment: This term was made obsolete because it was an unnecessary grouping term.
comment: Components of the DISC (death-inducing signaling complex) may be annotated to this term. These include ligand-bound receptors such as FAS/CD95 (though care should be taken because FAS can also act as a non-apoptotic signal transducer), and signaling molecules such as FADD (FAS-associated protein with a death domain), cIAPs (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins), c-FLIPs and caspases 8 and 10. Note that GO:0097296 should only be used to annotate gene products directly involved in the initiation or start up of an inactive cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in the apoptotic signaling pathway (also known as an initiator caspase). If the evidence provided is not sufficient to account for direct activation of this enzymatic activity, consider using the more generic terms GO:2001269 positive regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic signaling pathway or GO:0043280 positive regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process.

comment: Note that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
comment: It has been shown that receptor-mediated necroptotic signaling pathway requires assembly of a ripoptosome protein complex consisting of caspase-8, caspase-10, Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), casp8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) as well as the two receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3 (PMID:21737330). Optionally, depending on the receptor activated, this complex may contain TLR3 adaptor protein TRIF (PMID:21737330).
comment: BAX and BAK are involved in this process, as reviewed in PMID:21760595 (the human proteins have UniProt symbols Q07812 and Q16611 respectively).
comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct manual annotation of gene products. It was created to be used for cross-referencing by other ontologies. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.
comment: Neurofibrillary tangles have been found in aging population; their formation is increased in Alzheimer's disease patients (and in other neurological diseases) compared to normal controls (see PMID:848276 and PMID:8584267).

comment: This term was made obsolete because it was added in error; the specific activity it refers to has never been observed.
comment: This reaction requires the binding of a regulatory cyclin subunit and full activity requires stimulatory phosphorylation by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK).
comment: Gene products that may be annotated to this term include: 1) ligands such as TNF-alpha; 2) receptors such as TNFR (though care should be taken because TNF-alpha and TNFR may also be involved in non-necroptotic processes); 3) signaling molecules such as TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD), receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1), cIAP2, TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF5. Within the so-called complex I, RIP1 is polyubiquitinated by cIAPs, thereby providing a docking site for the recruitment of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) and TAB3 (which together deliver a pro-survival signal by activating the transcription factor NF-kB). In some pathophysiological and experimental settings, and in particular when caspase-8 is absent or when caspases are inhibited by pharmacological agents, cylindromatosis (CYLD)-deubiquitinated RIP1 engage in physical and functional interactions with its homolog RIP3, ultimately activating the execution of necrotic cell death. (The pathway downstream of RIPK3 remains largely unknown, although ROS generation, calcium overload, and the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore have been implicated (PMID:22265414)). A necroptotic signaling pathway may also be induced by alkylating DNA damage (possibly by the overactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, PARP1). This is sometimes referred to as PARP-dependent cell death or parthanatos; it is still being debated if it constitutes an independent cell death modality.
comment: In mammals, ciliary transition fibers comprise at least five components (Ccdc41/Cep83, Cep89/Cep123, Sclt1, Fbf1, and Cep164) (PMID:24469809).
comment: Note that cilia and eukaryotic flagella are deemed to be equivalent.
comment: Note that cilia and eukaryotic flagella are deemed to be equivalent.
comment: Note that 'ciliary shaft' is sparingly used in the literature to denote the projecting part of the cilium; many authors would refer to the axoneme instead. However, the definition of GO:0005930 'axoneme' is rather stringent, and the localization of many ciliary proteins would not fit that definition. Also, note that cilia and eukaryotic flagella are deemed to be equivalent.
comment: Due to resolution issues, researchers are often unable to assign protein localization to more specific ciliary compartments such as the basal body, transition fibers or transition zone, and instead refer to 'ciliary base'. The terms GO:0036064 'ciliary basal body', GO:0097539 'ciliary transition fiber' and GO:0035869 'ciliary transition zone' represent strictly defined compartments at the ciliary base and should be used for annotation whenever possible. Also, note that cilia and eukaryotic flagella are deemed to be equivalent.
comment: This term should not be confused with GO:0008021 'synaptic vesicle'. STVs and synaptic vesicles differ both functionally and morphologically. Functionally, STVs are transport vesicles that deliver synaptic vesicle proteins to synapses, while synaptic vesicles are responsible for transmitter release at synapses. Morphologically, synaptic vesicles are very homogeneous, while STVs are very heterogeneous in size and shape. STVs might be a precursor for synaptic vesicles.
comment: Note that the processes of nuclear double-strand break repair and mitochondrial double-strand break repair are genetically separable.

comment: Note that this activity is different from GO:0015038 'glutathione disulfide oxidoreductase activity'. See PMID:18992757: "Grxs [glutaredoxins] can also reduce mixed disulfides between proteins or low molecular weight thiols and GSH in reactions that require only their N-terminal active- site cysteine. It is important to note that the reduction of glutathionylated substrates through the monothiol mechanism seems to be the major activity of Grxs; all dithiol Grxs described so far catalyze these reactions, but not all dithiol Grxs catalyze the reduction of protein disulfides by the dithiol mechanism".
comment: Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. This term was added for mapping to the UniProt keyword "flagellar rotation". For manual annotation, please use one of the child terms of GO:0097588 that refer specifically to either archaeal- or bacterial-type flagella.

comment: Note that we deem cilium and microtubule-based flagellum to be equivalent. In this case community usage refers to 'flagellum' rather than 'cilium', hence the primary term name, but the cilium parentage is deliberate.

comment: The term name refers to a taxonomic group to make the label unique with respect to similarly-named anatomical structures.
comment: The term 'annealing' is often used to describe the binding of a DNA probe, or the binding of a primer to a DNA strand during a polymerase chain reaction. The term is also often used to describe the reformation (renaturation) of complementary strands that were separated by heat (thermally denatured). For example, proteins such as RAD52 can help DNA anneal. If at all possible, please annotate to the more specific terms GO:0036310 'annealing helicase activity', GO:0097098 'DNA/RNA hybrid annealing activity' or GO:0033592 'RNA strand annealing activity'.

Also, the ventral (front) side of a dinoflagellate cell is the one where the sulcus is located (as opposed to the dorsal (back) side). The term 'sulcal notch' appears mostly in older literature; more recently, indication of a bilobed hypocone is used to express the same.
comment: In the yeast Rhodotorula graminis, (R)-mandelate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme of the mandelate pathway, and catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of (R)-mandelate to phenylglyoxylate.
comment: Acts on primary amines, and also on some secondary and tertiary amines. It differs from EC:1.4.3.21, primary-amine oxidase as it can oxidize secondary and tertiary amines but not methylamine.

comment: An example of this is human hepcidin (UniProt symbol P81172), which regulates iron transport out of cells (see PMID:15514116).
comment: In most species, STAT proteins are activated by members of the JAK (Janus Activated Kinase) family of tyrosine kinases; the term GO:0007259 'JAK-STAT cascade' describes this specificity. In other cases, such as D. discoideum, no JAK orthologs are known, and STAT proteins are activated by tyrosine kinase-like proteins.
comment: This term should only be used when the small subunit consists of more than one polypeptide.
comment: Basal bodies in jawed vertebrates appear to first attach to a ciliary vesicle. It is unclear how specific this is to jawed vertebrates or if other organisms also employ this sequence. Some species like Giardia intestinalis do not relocate their basal bodies to the plasma membrane, but have their axonemes extend through the cytosol to then protrude out of the cell to form flagella.
comment: The blepharoplast should not be confused with a basal body; rather, it acts as the precursor assembly zone for multiple basal bodies.
comment: This type of cilia may be present in solitary (classic nodal cilia in embryonic nodes) or in multiple copies (e.g. in the choroid plexus epithelium).
comment: This type of cilia may be present in solitary (so-called flagella, e.g. in sperm) or in multiple copies (so-called conventional motile cilia, e.g. in tracheal epithelium, ependyma or oviduct epithelium).

comment: This term was obsoleted because it corresponded to an existing term, GO:0042310 ; vasocontriction.
comment: This process was historically defined by the release, by Waring blending or sonication, by dilution and centrifugation, or by filtration and washing, of infective virions from their complexes with cells, thus contrary to what is observed after irreversible adsorption.
comment: Generalized transducing phages usually use this mode of DNA packaging.
comment: This term should only be used when the large subunit consists of more than one polypeptide.
comment: Many bacteriophages with dsDNA genomes, or Caudovirales, have a tail. The viral tail can be short (Podoviridae), long and non-contractile (Siphoviridae) or long and contractile (Myoviridae). The tail is the channel through which the phage genome is injected into the host bacterial cell.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that these are not precise structures: major (most abundant) and minor subunits of viral tails vary in different viruses/phages.
comment: The reason for obsoletion is that these are not precise structures: major (most abundant) and minor subunits of viral tails vary in different viruses/phages.
comment: For tailed bacteriophages, fibers typically bind to particular Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polysaccharide or protein receptors on the cell surface.
comment: Tail fibers are often attached to the baseplate of Caudovirales (tailed bacteriophages with dsDNA genomes). Sometimes referred to as the tail tip or tip structure in Siphoviridae.
comment: Applies in particular the Myoviridae bacteriophages.
comment: This term applies in particular to the Siphoviridae bacteriophages, where the shaft is the channel for DNA translocation into the host cytoplasm.
comment: Note that the type II protein secretion system complex does not include components of the Sec or Tat pathways. For components of these pathways, consider annotating to 'cell envelope Sec complex ; GO:0031522' or 'TAT protein translocation system complex ; GO:0033281'.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it represents a molecular function, and not a specific coordinated process.

comment: Note, this is not classified under 'detection of chemical stimulus' as there are various potential mechanisms of hygroperception including detection of mechanical stimulus.
comment: To be used for NTP->NDP or NDP -> NMP. For nucleotide -> nucleoside (all phosphates removed) use nucleotidase.
comment: Inhibitory neuromuscular junctions are found in arthropods but not in vertebrates.
comment: In vertebrates, the term 'neuromuscular junction' is limited to synapses targeting skeletal muscle fibers - all of which are  cholinergic and excitatory.  Both inhibitory and excitatory neuromuscular junctions exist in invertebrates, utilizing a range of neurotransmitters including glutamate, GABA and 5-HT.
comment: In vertebrates, the term 'neuromuscular junction' is limited to synapses targeting the myotubes of skeletal muscle (AKA skeletal muscle fibers). Neuromuscular junctions targeting other muscle cell types exist in invertebrates such as the mononucleate somatic muscles of nematodes.
comment: For usage guidance, see comment in GO:0003700 ; DNA-binding transcription factor activity.
comment: The location of this complex is implicit in its activity, so its location is asserted as a regular relationship rather than as a part of an intersection.
comment: In most eukaryotic cells, 'centriole' (GO:0005814) and 'ciliary basal body' (GO:0036064) represent a common entity that cycles through its function in cell division, then ciliogenesis, then cell division again. However, these structures are modified extensively as they transition into each other, and may contain different proteins, specific to each component.
comment: In GO, 'external side' still refers to part of the membrane and does not refer to components beyond (outside of) the membrane.

comment: A number of complexes of this class are found in E.coli.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it represents a biological process, not a cellular localization.
comment: Examples include human speech and learned bird song.
comment: Examples include the outer membranes of double membrane bound organelles such as mitochondria as well as the bounding membranes of single-membrane bound organelles such as lysosomes.
comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct manual annotation as it should always be possible to choose a more specific subclass.
comment: Observation here is used in a broad sense to include perception of the behavior of others via any form or combination of forms of sensory perception (visual, auditory etc). Observational learning is broader than imitative learning in that it does not require a duplication of the behavior exhibited by the model.
comment: This grouping term is necessary because, in the absence of conditional mutations, it is not possible to use phenotypic evidence to distinguish an effect on vocal learning from an effect on learned vocalisation behavior.
comment: Made part of peptidyl-N-phospho-arginine phosphatase activity on the assumption that arginine phosphorylation in proteins occurs via an N link.
comment: This term was obsoleted because it does not represent a physiological process.

comment: Examples include the self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells and (some) division during amplification of skeletal muscle satellite cell populations.
comment: This term was obsoleted because there is no evidence that this process exists.
comment: Additional components may be present, for example in ascomycetes this complex includes an additional regulatory subunit, Edc1.
comment: Not to be used for manual annotation.  Please choose a more specific cell development term or if not possible, bone or bone tissue development.
comment: Examples include many myristoylated proteins.
comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation should be to 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (e.g. mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: This term is defined so as to leave open the possibility that things other than curli subunits are secreted via same secretory system as that used by curli subunits.
comment: While making xenophagy a subclass of (macro)autophagy may seem to directly contradict the definition of autophagy (literally self eating), it is clear that the same pathway is involved as in macroautophagy that doesn't target foreign material: formation of double-membrane-bounded autophagosomes that enclose a region of cytoplasm for degradation.

comment: The ion channels through which current flows during an action potential should be annotated to the process 'action potential'. Gene products involved in modulating the characteristics of an action potential via changing the expression levels or the activity of these channels (e.g. modulating their kinetics or voltage sensitivity) should be annotated to this regulation term.

comment: Note, although the SHRED pathway may contain some components in common with ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathways (GO:0036503), such as UBR1, RAD6 and CDC48, other ERAD components, such as HRD1 and DOA10 do not appear to be involved, and as such these pathways are currently considered to be distinct. ERAD pathways target misfolded ER lumenal proteins (ERAD-L), ER membrane proteins (ERAD-M) and ER proteins with misfolded cytosolic domains (ERAD-C) by recognizing aberrant proteins, retrotranslocating these substrates to the cytosol, followed by subsequent substrate ubiquitination and proteosome-mediated degradation. In contrast the SHRED pathway, although inducible by stress, targets diverse ER membrane and cytosolic proteins as well as numerous other native proteins in the absence of stress. In the SHRED pathway an Nma111p serine protease-mediated cleavage results in the generation of a Roq1p fragment that then binds to the type-1 active site of Ubr1p, altering its substrate specificity, and leading to the proteasome-mediated degradation of both misfolded and native proteins. SHRED is also considered to be distinct from the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (GO:0030968), a process by which ER stress activates the ER membrane protein Ire1p, resulting in splicing of the HAC1 mRNA, followed by Hac1p-mediated up-regulation of UPR genes. Induction of SHRED does not require IRE1 or HAC1, and as such is currently considered to be distinct.

comment: This enzyme, which has been found in all species and tissues examined, catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of imine intermediates formed by several types of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent dehydratases, such as EC 4.3.1.19 and EC 4.3.1.17. The reactions, which can occur spontaneously, are accelerated to minimize the cellular damage that could be caused by these reactive intermediates. {xref="EC:3.5.99.10"}

comment: Note that cilia and eukaryotic flagella are deemed to be equivalent. In diplomonad species, such as Giardia, the axoneme may extend intracellularly up to 5um away from the plane of the plasma membrane.
comment: Pro-basal bodies are distinct from basal bodies as they are not at the base of a cilium and are not capable of nucleating a cilium. While immature, they contain some structures in common with the mature basal body and also may contain proteins unique to the immature state. Note that cilia and eukaryotic flagella are deemed to be equivalent. In many eukaryotic cells, 'ciliary basal body' (GO:0036064) and 'centriole' (GO:0005814) represent a common entity that cycles through its function in cell division, then ciliogenesis, then cell division again. However, these structures are modified extensively as they transition into each other, and may contain different proteins, specific to each component. In other eukaryotic cells, centrioles are not involved in cell division but only in cilium assembly, which is thought to be the ancestral role of the centriole/basal body.
comment: This term should only be used when the binding is shown to require a post-translational modification: the interaction needs to be tested with and without the PTM. The binding does not need to be at the site of the modification. It may be that the PTM causes a conformational change that allows binding of the protein to another region; this type of modification-dependent protein binding is valid for annotation to this term.
comment: This term should only be used when the binding is shown to require phosphorylation of the target protein: the interaction needs to be tested with and without the PTM. The binding does not need to be at the site of phosphorylation.

comment: This term should only be used when the binding is shown to require glycosylation of the target protein: the interaction needs to be tested with and without the PTM. The binding does not need to be at the site of glycosylation.

comment: This term should only be used when the binding is shown to require acetylation of the target protein: the interaction needs to be tested with and without the PTM. The binding does not need to be at the site of acetylation. It may be that the acetylation causes a conformational change that allows binding of the protein to another region; this type of acetylation-dependent protein binding is valid for annotation to this term.
comment: This term should only be used when the binding is shown to require methylation of the target protein: the interaction needs to be tested with and without the PTM. The binding does not need to be at the site of methylation. It may be that the methylation causes a conformational change that allows binding of the protein to another region; this type of methylation-dependent protein binding is valid for annotation to this term.
comment: This term should only be used when the binding is shown to require a ubiquitin-like modification in the target protein: the interaction needs to be tested with and without the PTM. The binding does not need to be at the site of ubiquitin-like modification.

comment: This term should only be used when the binding is shown to require sumoylation of the target protein: the interaction needs to be tested with and without the PTM. The binding does not need to be at the site of sumoylation. It may be that the sumoylation causes a conformational change that allows binding of the protein to another region; this type of sumoylation-dependent protein binding is valid for annotation to this term.
comment: Note that a carrier moves with its substrate/cargo, while a transporter does not move with the cargo, but facilitates the change in localization.
comment: This term covers zinc(2+) import *across* the endoplasmic reticulum membrane through a channel or pore. It does not cover import via vesicle fusion with endoplasmic reticulum membrane, as in this case transport does not involve crossing the membrane.
comment: Usage guidance: The distinction between general transcription factors and DNA-binding transcription factors is that the latter modulate the selection of which genes are expressed under specific conditions, while general transcription factors are the constitutive machinery required for transcription initiation.

comment: Note that this term is meant to annotate effectors for which the evolved activity is to act as a ligand to activate (for necrotrophs) or suppress (for biotrophs) the host immune system. It should not be used to annotate PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules) or similar types of microbial proteins recognized by the host innate immune system (for example, PAMPs are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in both plants and animals). PAMPs activate innate immune responses, protecting the host from infection, but this is not the molecular function of PAMPs; those usually form the structure of the bacterial cell wall.

comment: Examples of protein carriers include the soluble TIM chaperone complexes of S. cerevisiae Tim9-Tim10 and Tim8-Tim13, that provide a shuttle system between TOM and the membrane insertases TIM22 and SAM and, thus, ensure that precursors are kept in a translocation-competent conformation.
comment: Nomenclature note. Flippases and floppases are ATP-dependent transbilayer lipid translocators. According to an extensively used, though not universal, nomenclature, they catalyze lipid transfer towards the inward monolayer (flippases) or towards the outward monolayer (floppases). Scramblases are ATP-independent, non-selective, inducing non-specific transbilayer movements across the membrane. The direction of the translocation should be taken into account for annotation (from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic leaftlet of a membrane).

comment: Usage guidance: transcription regulator inhibitors bind to a transcription regulator to prevent it from reaching the chromatin. This activity does not occur at the promoter. For activities that do occur at the promoter, consider GO:0001217 ; DNA-binding transcription repressor activity or GO:0003714 ; transcription corepressor activity. An example of a transcription regulator is TCF23 Q7RTU1 is an example of a protein that regulates transcription factors by heterodimerising or binding to DbTFs and prevent DNA binding and their specific genomic binding site where the dbTF would have activated or repressed transcription. Also an example is NFKBIA P25963 which has a different way of regulating transcription factor activity by sequestering the dbTF (complex) in the cytoplasm. Another example is the HSP90 and HSP23 proteins that sequester steroid receptors away from the DNA.

comment: This term was made obsolete is that in these terms the 'involved in' process is not truly involved_in (i.e. part_of) the process but instead is causally upstream of it. We advise replacing annotations to these terms with annotations + extensions using the causally_upstream_of relation e.g. P1234 regulation of gene expression [causally_upstream_of] extracellular matrix organization.

comment: Dendritic filopodia are generally less-well studied than dendritic spines because their transient nature makes them difficult to detect with traditional microscopy techniques, and because they are sometimes destroyed by sample preparation. Note that filopodia on dendritic shafts are distinct from other types of filopodia (even those found in dendritic growth cones) and may react differently to stimuli, as shown in PMID:12904473.

comment: Examples of protein-lipid-RNA complexes are described in PMID:21423178 and PMID:23559634, both showing evidence that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, to a lesser extent, low-density lipoprotein (HDL) transport endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) and deliver them to recipient cells with functional targeting capabilities. Also see fig. 1 in the review PMID:22028337. Not to be confused with GO:0034364 'high-density lipoprotein particle' or GO:0034362 'low-density lipoprotein particle', which describe complexes of proteins and lipids only, without RNAs.

comment: This term was made obsolete because microtubule-based flagellum (GO:0009434) and motile cilium (GO:0031514), as referenced by this term, were determined to be equivalent and merged. When a merge for this term was considered, it was noticed that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are annotated to it because its meaning had been ambiguous so obsoletion was considered safest.

comment: This term was made obsolete is that in these terms the 'involved in' process is not truly involved_in (i.e. part_of) the process but instead is causally upstream of it. We advise replacing annotations to these terms with annotations + extensions using the causally_upstream_of relation e.g. P1234 regulation of gene expression [causally_upstream_of] extracellular matrix organization.

comment: This relation is currently used to connect two regulation processes p1 and p2, such that if r1 regulates p1 and r2 regulates p2, and r1 results_in r2 then the regulation of p1 is required for the regulation of p2. For an example of use, see GO:0035958 'regulation of glyoxylate cycle by regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter'. Note that a precise definition of this relation is under discussion. After it has been formalized it will be added to RO, where it will have a RO ID. Note that the existing identifier and label are subject to change.
