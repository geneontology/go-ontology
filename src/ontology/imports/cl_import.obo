comment: The definition of cell is intended to represent all cells, and thus a cell is defined as a material entity and not an anatomical structure, which implies that it is part of an organism (or the entirety of one).

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nMale germ cells are specialized cells that give rise to the male gametes and are therefore crucial for sexual reproduction in males. Through a complex process called spermatogenesis in the testes male germ cells undergo several stages of development, each with distinctive morphological and physiological characteristics, eventually differentiating into mature spermatozoa (sperm). \nMale germ cells are responsible for transferring genetic material from male to offspring as part of sexual reproduction. In the initial stage of their life cycle, they exist as spermatogonial stem cells, which multiply by mitotic division to self-renew and to produce daughter cells. The daughter cells then undergo meiotic division, a process that reduces the number of chromosomes in each cell by half, from diploid to haploid – the formation of spermatids. This is critical for maintaining genetic stability from generation to generation, as it ensures that when an egg and sperm cell unite during fertilization, the resulting offspring will have the correct number of chromosomes. The final phase of spermatogenesis is called spermiogenesis, during which spermatozoa - mature and motile sperm cells – are produced from round spermatids. \nThe matured male germ cells or sperm cells are highly specialized, having a streamlined shape designed for efficient movement towards the female egg. A sperm cell is divided into three main parts, namely the head, midpiece, and tail. The head contains the genetic material, the midpiece contains mitochondria that provide energy, and the tail, termed as the flagellum, propels the sperm cell forward. Each of these parts play significant roles in fertilization." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81834-6", xref="DOI:10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00173-9", xref="DOI:10.1242/dev.202046", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553142/"}

Structurally, a sperm cell possesses two main structures: the head, containing the nucleus carrying the paternal genetic information, and the flagellum, which generates energy and grants the sperm cell mobility\nThe process of fertilization occurs when one sperm cell successfully penetrates the egg, delivering its genetic information, and ultimately leading to the formation of a new individual combining both paternal and maternal genetic materials. Notably, while hundreds of millions of sperm cells may be released during ejaculation, only one has the opportunity to successfully fertilize the egg, underscoring the highly competitive nature of this biological process." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1080/19420889.2015.1017156", xref="DOI:10.1152/physrev.00009.2020", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26914/"}

Hematopoietic stem cells lack cell markers of effector cells (lin-negative). Lin-negative is defined by lacking one or more of the following cell surface markers: CD2, CD3 epsilon, CD4, CD5 ,CD8 alpha chain, CD11b, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD56, ly6G, ter119." [GOC:add, GOC:dsd, GOC:tfm, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell, PMID:19022770]
comment: Markers differ between species, and two sets of markers have been described for mice. HSCs are reportedly CD34-positive, CD45-positive, CD48-negative, CD150-positive, CD133-positive, and CD244-negative.

[GOC:tfm, ISBN:0721662544, PMID:26106328]
comment: Mesothelial cells, which morphologically resemble squamous epithelial cells, express both epithelial markers (cytokeratins) and mesenchymal markers (vimentin), reflecting their mesodermal origin. They feature surface microvilli and apical-basal polarity. Under certain conditions, they can undergo mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These cells also produce extracellular matrix proteins, maintain serosal homeostasis, and facilitate fluid transport. {xref="PMID:26106328"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nOsteoclasts, derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage, play a crucial role in bone remodeling through bone resorption. They are distinguished from other cells by their large size and their unique ability to secrete enzymes and acids that dissolve the calcium phosphate in bone. The formation of osteoclasts is influenced by two primary factors: macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and the ligand-activated receptor (RANKL) of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB).\nOsteoclasts also collaborate with osteoblasts, responsible for new bone formation, to maintain bone health and adapt bone structure. Their coordinated actions allow continuous remodeling while preserving overall bone strength and integrity. Imbalances in osteoclast activity can lead to pathological conditions. For example, excessive activity may contribute to diseases like osteoporosis, periprosthetic osteolysis, bone tumors, and Paget's disease.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nMononuclear phagocytes are immune cells that form a critical part of the body's innate immune system, the body's first line of defense against infections. Mononuclear phagocytes are characterized by the presence of a single, large nucleus. The ‘Mononuclear Phagocyte System’ nomenclature was introduced to distinguish mononuclear monocytes and macrophages from other cells with multiple nuclei. However, the cells within the mononuclear phagocyte system represent a highly heterogeneous group, all of which are able to perform highly efficient phagocytosis - engulfing and digesting microbes and cellular debris to fight infections and to maintain normal tissue homeostasis. \nIn addition to phagocytosis, mononuclear phagocytes also secrete chemical compounds to recruit other immune cells to a site of infection. These cells produce different types of signaling molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, triggering a cascade of responses to ensure rapid and efficient containment and neutralization of invading pathogens. These cells are also involved in antigen presentation, a process essential for stimulating an adaptive immune response. They can process and present antigens to T cells, thereby linking the innate and adaptive immune responses.\nMononuclear phagocytes play key roles in tissue repair and remodeling. After infection or injury, these cells help in the clearance of dead cells and debris, a crucial step in the initiation of tissue remodeling and the resolution of inflammation. Overall, mononuclear phagocytes are versatile cells that have tailored their functions to meet the unique challenges of different tissues within the body. They are pivotal in homeostasis, immunity, and inflammation, making them important aspects in a range of human diseases including infection, autoimmunity, and cancer." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.coi.2005.11.008", xref="DOI:10.1038/nri3087", xref="DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2019.01893"}

They are critical during the early stages of embryonic development, where they delineate and create the organism's exterior body plan. Beyond forming the organism's physical exterior, surface ectodermal cells have other significant roles. For instance, these cells lead to the development of the anterior pituitary gland and the enamel of the teeth. They are also integral to the formation of the sensory organs, including the eyes and the ears. In the eyes, they form the cornea and lens epithelium. In the ears, they form the external ear canal and certain parts of the inner ear. Therefore, these cells are instrumental in the development of various sensory systems in an organism.\nCertain abnormalities or mutations in surface ectodermal cells could lead to medical conditions known as ectodermal dysplasias. These are a group of inherited disorders affecting the development or function of teeth, hair, nails, and sweat glands. Therefore, understanding the formation and function of surface ectodermal cells is also important in identifying and addressing certain genetic disorders and conditions.

comment: From FMA: 9.07.2001: Endothelial cell has always been classified as a kind of epithelial cell, specifically a squamous cell but that is not true. First, endothelial cell can either be squamous or cuboidal (e.g. high-endothelial cell) and secondly, it has different embryological derivation (mesodermal) than a true epithelial cell (ectodermal and endodermal). The basis for present classification is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell. Endothelial cell has vimentin filaments while an epithelial cell has keratin filaments. [Onard].

They are a critical part of the vertebrate nervous system as they provide the only signal output from the cortex to the cerebellar nuclei. They are one of the few types of neurons that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. The most distinct hallmark of Purkinje cells is their elaborate dendritic arbor, which forms a broad and intricately branching structure resembling a tree. These numerous branches each receive excitatory synaptic inputs from more than 100,000 parallel fibers; in addition, a single climbing fiber makes hundreds of synapses to the soma and proximal dendrites. A single long axon forms an inhibitory projection to the cerebellar nuclei.\nPurkinje cells play key roles in the coordination of fine, voluntary motor movements and balance. As the sole output of all motor coordination in the cerebellar cortex, they serve as a central relay in the cerebro-cerebellar loop. Each Purkinje cell receives two types of synaptic input: one from parallel fibers (which are axons of granule cells), and the other from climbing fibers (originating from the inferior olivary nucleus). The Purkinje cells process and integrate these diverse kinds of input signals to generate output that controls timing and coordination of movements.\nPurkinje neurons show considerable synaptic plasticity. Throughout life, these cells continue to undergo long-term potentiation and depression at parallel fiber synapses, which cause long-lasting increase or decrease, respectively, of synaptic transmission and have been proposed as mechanisms for motor learning. \nPurkinje cells are also known to be implicated in a variety of diseases. Their progressive loss is a prime feature in certain types of ataxia, a collective term used to describe conditions characterized by loss of muscular control and coordination. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the density of Purkinje cells has been reported in conditions such as autism and Huntington’s disease." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1007/s12311-018-0985-7", xref="DOI:10.1038/nrn3886", xref="DOI:10.7554/eLife.63668", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545154/", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/purkinje-cell"}

They constitute approximately half of the total cells in the human brain and more than half in other parts of the nervous system. Glial cells perform several key functions including, but not limited to, maintaining homeostasis, forming the myelin sheath around the neuron axons, and providing support and nutrition to neurons.\nThese different functions are performed by various glial cell types, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and other specialized types. Astrocytes, for example, are the most abundant glial cells and provide metabolic and nutrient support to neurons, help regulate the extracellular ion and neurotransmitter levels, and play a role in the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, contributing to the overall homeostasis and functioning of the nervous system. Additionally, astrocytes are involved in synaptic communication and participate in processes such as synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning.\nOligodendrocytes in the central nervous system function to insulate neurons by producing a fatty substance known as myelin. The myelin sheath enhances the speed and efficiency of nerve impulse conduction along the axons. \nMicroglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system, protect neurons from pathogens and clear away dead neurons through phagocytosis, a process also known as cellular eating. They also contribute to the regulation of inflammation in response to signals of tissue damage or infection in the central nervous system by releasing cytokines and other signaling molecules that modulate the immune response.\nDespite their overarching function in the support and protection of neurons, glial cells have also been shown to play significant roles in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease and multiple sclerosis." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/glia.24343", xref="DOI:10.1038/nn1988", xref="DOI:10.1101/cshperspect.a020602", xref="DOI:10.1126/science.aat0473", xref="DOI:10.3389/fncel.2017.00024"}

Classified among the resident immune cells, microglial cells represent about 10% of all cells found within the CNS.

They express a vast repertoire of pattern recognition receptors, which allow them to sense and eliminate microbes invading the CNS parenchyma. They represent one of the macrophage populations of the CNS and are responsible for phagocytosis (engulfing and destroying cellular waste or pathogens) in the neural environment. \nMicroglial cells are particularly responsive to pathogens and injuries and change their morphology in reaction to inflammation or insult: In the normal state they are characterized by a ramified shape with small processes; in response to stimuli, some microglia mature and change to an amoeboid shape. \nBeyond their macrophagic activity, they also perform synaptic pruning during brain development, eliminate unnecessarily produced neurons, and facilitate tissue regeneration and repair. they play integral roles in regulating neural development and supporting cell survival and are important for maintaining tissue homeostasis. \nWhile their protective role generally benefits the brain, their over-activation can occasionally lead to neuro-inflammatory diseases, underlining the importance of balanced microglial cell functions.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nGoblet cells are specialized, simple columnar, secretory epithelial cells that are mostly found in the respiratory and intestinal tracts. The term \"goblet\" refers to their shape, which resembles a flask or goblet, specially at their apical end which is swollen due to the accumulation of secretory granules. \nThe primary function of goblet cells is to to protect and lubricate the underlying tissues by secreting large quantities of mucin, a complex glycoprotein, which forms mucus when hydrated. In the respiratory tract, the mucus secreted by these cells traps dust, bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful particles in the inhaled air, preventing them from reaching the delicate tissues of the lungs. In the intestines, the goblet cells secrete mucus that acts as a protective barrier shielding the intestinal epithelium from dietary antigens, pathogens and prevents the intestinal epithelium from being eroded by the actions of the digestive enzymes and the abrasive action of passing food material.\nGoblet cells are capable of rapidly altering their secretory output in response to stimuli. For example, irritants like smoke or dust can trigger an increased rate of mucus production, as the body attempts to flush out the harmful particles. Conversely, in conditions such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis, overactive goblet cells can create a thick accumulation of mucus that obstructs the airways and fosters bacterial growth. Lastly, goblet cells are not static, rather, they undergo a dynamic process known as goblet cell metaplasia-differentiation, wherein non-goblet cells in response to chronic injury or inflammation, can differentiate into goblet cells leading to an accumulation of these cells in the tissue, known as goblet cell hyperplasia." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/S1357-2725(02)00083-3", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41575-022-00675-x", xref="DOI:10.1165/ajrcmb.25.5.f218", xref="DOI:10.1242/bio.20121701", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553208/"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nEnteroendocrine cells are a specialized subset of cells located within the epithelial lining of both the small and large intestines, as well as the stomach and pancreas. Constituting less than 1% of the total population of intestinal cells, they are differentiated from a common intestinal cell progenitor, thus sharing lineage with absorptive and goblet cells of the intestines.\nThe distinct characteristic feature of an enteroendocrine cell is its inherent capacity to synthesize and secrete a plethora of gut hormones such as serotonin, somatostatin, neurotensin, cholecystokinin, secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide, motilin, and glucagon-like peptide-1. Integrated within this complex network of signaling agents, these substances control various aspects of the digestive system. Each enteroendocrine cell has its unique combination of hormones to release, determined by its position along the intestinal tract. Intriguingly, these hormones not only modulate local gut function, including motility, absorption and secretion, but also potentiate distant actions on other systems such as endocrine, nervous and immune and play a role in the feeling of satiety.\nThe release of these hormones from enteroendocrine cells is a highly regulated and dynamic process. The cells are equipped with sensory receptors localized on its luminal side that respond to various stimuli, including changes in nutrient composition, chemical or mechanical changes in the gut lumen, or even signals arising from commensal microbiota. This sensory input stimulates a signaling cascade within the cell, culminating in the release of specific hormones into the interstitial fluid. These hormones then make their way into the bloodstream, acting on their respective target receptors to mediate their duties. The multifunctional characteristics of enteroendocrine cells make them crucial for maintaining gut homeostasis and the overall physiological well being of the body." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/s41574-019-0168-8", xref="DOI:10.1111/j.1463-1326.2011.01438.x", xref="DOI:10.1196/annals.1294.001", xref="DOI:10.1210/endrev/bnaa018", xref="DOI:10.7554/elife.78512"}

Chromaffin cells are also found in small clusters, known as paraganglia, in various locations throughout the body, including the sympathetic nervous system. They derive their name from their ability to stain a brownish-black color upon exposure to chromic salts, a feature made possible due to their high content of granules rich in catecholamines and catecholamine-related neurotransmitters.\nThe primary function of chromaffin cells is the synthesis and release of catecholamines, specifically epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). These neurotransmitters are vital stress hormones that, when released by the adrenal chromaffing cells into the bloodstream, prepare the body for the 'fight or flight' response. This response can enhance the body's performance in a dangerous situation by increasing heart rate, elevating blood sugar, and increasing blood flow to the muscles. The chromaffin cells in paraganglia are responsible for the local release of catecholamines and play a role in regulating blood pressure and other autonomic functions.\nIn addition to their role in stress response, chromaffin cells also contribute to the body's immune response.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nLeydig cells are a testosterone-secreting cell in the interstitial area in the testes of males. They are named after Franz Leydig, a German anatomist who discovered these cells in 1850. Uniquely situated within the soft connective tissue surrounding the seminiferous tubules, Leydig cells form an integral part of the male reproductive system. They are usually polygonal cells characterized by well developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum, high lipid content and a large round nucleus. They are found across mammalian species, including humans. \nThe primary function of Leydig cells is the production of androgens, the male sex hormones, the most notable of which is testosterone. Leydig cells synthesize testosterone from cholesterol through a series of enzymatic reactions. The production and release of testosterone are mainly regulated by the luteinizing hormone (LH) released by the anterior pituitary gland. In response to LH, Leydig cells convert cholesterol into testosterone, which then plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of primary and secondary male sexual characteristics. These include the formation and maturation of male reproductive organs, onset of spermatogenesis, and the presentation of male secondary sexual traits such as the deepening of the voice, growth of facial hair, development of muscles, and a broadening of shoulders.\nApart from testosterone production, Leydig cells also secrete insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3) that is essential for testicular descent during embryonic development in males. Dysregulation or loss of Leydig cells can lead to numerous conditions like testosterone deficiency, infertility, and certain forms of testicular cancer. Although not typical, Leydig cells can regenerate if they are damaged, ensuring the continuous production of testosterone and maintaining male reproductive health. They provide an excellent model to study cell differentiation and hormone regulation, thereby enhancing our understanding of reproductive biology and associated disorders." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.coemr.2019.03.001", xref="DOI:10.1093/biolre/ioy059", xref="DOI:10.1210/clinem/dgaa603", xref="DOI:10.3389/fendo.2014.00006", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556007/#:~:text=Leydig%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,secondary%20sexual%20characteristics%20and%20behaviors."}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nHepatocytes are the major cell type constituting 70-80% of the liver's cytoplasmic mass, playing crucial roles in maintaining the body's metabolic homeostasis. Dimensions of mature hepatocytes typically range from 20 to 30 μm in humans, but size may vary depending on their location within the liver lobule. Hepatocytes are characterized by high biosynthetic, enzymatic, and endocytic activity. They contain abundant mitochondria, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and a large nucleus that is often binucleate. \nThe liver consists of three zones - the periportal Zone 1, midzone 2, and pericentral Zone 3 - which have differential nutrient and oxygen status, and damage susceptibility; hepatocytes in the different zones show signifcant functional heterogeneity ('hepatocyte functional zonation'). Hepatocytes are involved in a multitude of critical functions including the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins, the synthesis of serum proteins (e.g., albumin, transferrin, and lipoproteins), the detoxification and excretion of endogenous and exogenous substances, the storage of vitamins and minerals, and the production and secretion of bile. \nHeterocytes demonstrate a remarkable regenerative capacity, which enables the liver to recover from injury and loss of tissue mass. Notably, hepatocytes perform biotransformation with both phase I and phase II enzymes, which modify drugs, xenobiotics, and various substances for elimination from the body. Phase I enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, catalyze both oxidative and reductive reactions of many xenobiotics; many of the products of phase I enzymes are substrates for the phase II enzymes, which catalyze conjugation reactions. \nAlterations in hepatocyte function have significant implications for overall human health and disease. Certain conditions, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, can profoundly affect hepatocyte structure and function, thereby disrupting the liver's ability to perform its vital roles within the body. As the primary site for drug metabolism, changes in hepatocyte function can also impact the effectiveness and toxicity of pharmaceuticals. The regenerative ability of hepatocytes makes them valuable cells for liver regenerative medicine and bioartificial liver support systems, and their study has provided significant insights into liver biology and disease." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.biocel.2011.11.011", xref="DOI:10.1055/s-2007-1007096", xref="DOI:10.1083/jcb.201903090", xref="DOI:10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00752.x"}

These elongated, multi-nucleated cells convert ATP into mechanical energ and are key for voluntary movement and posture. They also are responsible for maintaining body temperature, storing nutrients, and stabilizing joints.\nSkeletal muscle cells organize themselves tightly into bundles to form muscle fibers. Embedded within each of these cells are thousands of myofibrils, which are made up of the contractile proteins, actin (the thin filament), and myosin (the thick filament). Contraction of a skeletal muscle cell occurs when these myofibrils shorten, a process driven by the sliding of actin and myosin filaments over each other in a mechanism famously known as the sliding filament theory.\nAdditionally, skeletal muscle cells exhibit a high degree of plasticity, which allows for their adaptation in response to alterations in functional demands or damages. They have an innate regenerative capacity due to the presence of satellite cells—quiescent muscle stem cells that reside within the muscle fibers. Upon muscle injury, these satellite cells become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into new muscle cells, thereby contributing to the repair and growth of injured skeletal muscle. With this, skeletal muscle cells serve not only a pivotal biomechanical function but also possess a great capacity for self-healing and regeneration." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/cphy.c160033", xref="DOI:10.3390/biology10101056", xref="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-sliding-filament-theory-of-muscle-contraction-14567666/", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537139", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9961/"}

They are also referred to as type I, slow-twitch, or red muscles because of their high myoglobin content which gives them a dark, reddish appearance. These cells are predominantly found in the postural muscles of the body, such as those in the back and lower limbs. \nA defining characteristic of slow muscle cells is their significant resistance to fatigue. This is largely due to their efficient oxidative metabolism, which allows them to continuously contract over extended periods without succumbing to fatigue. This extraordinary endurance is facilitated by a high concentration of mitochondria, which enables the efficient use of oxygen for energy production, and capillaries, which supplies the necessary oxygen and nutrients. Additionally, these cells have an abundant supply of myoglobin, a protein that stores and transports oxygen within the muscle cell, further supporting their aerobic metabolism.\nThe primary role of slow muscle cells in the human body is to provide sustained, low-intensity contractions over a prolonged period. They are responsible for maintaining posture and providing stability, rather than delivering short, powerful bursts of activity. They play a pivotal role in supporting various physical activities such as standing, walking, or any form of exercise that requires endurance over speed." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1093/ptj/81.11.1810", xref="DOI:10.1186/s13578-015-0054-6", xref="DOI:10.3389/fphys.2021.747214", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/slow-muscle-fiber"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nSmooth muscle cells are a specialized type of muscle cells that are primarily found within the walls of hollow organs such as the intestine, stomach, bladder, uterus, and blood vessels. These cells are an essential component of the autonomic nervous system controling involuntary movements within the body.\nSmooth muscle cells play a vital role in many physiological processes due to their unique functionality. They can contract and relax in a slow, sustained, and controlled manner to help modulate the size and shape of the lumens of the organs they surround. For example, in the digestive system, coordinated contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells propels food along the gastrointestinal tract - a process known as peristalsis. In the blood vessels, the smooth muscle cells, by contracting or relaxing, either constrict or dilate the vessels, which in turn, help regulate blood flow and pressure.\nOn a cellular level, smooth muscle cells possess a single, centrally located nucleus and contain an arranged network of actin and myosin filaments, which are the proteins responsible for muscle contraction. Unlike their counterparts in skeletal or cardiac muscles, these cells lack specific contact points for these filaments, hence the lack of visible striations. Furthermore, the contraction of smooth muscle cells is regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, adding an additional layer of complex regulation to these highly specialized cells." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1093/ptj/81.11.1810", xref="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/muscular/types.html", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10854/", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526125", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556137/"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nGametes are reproductive cells essential for sexual reproduction in eukaryotic organisms, including humans, animals, and many plants. These cells are haploid, containing half the genome or only one set of chromosomes, which is a contrast to the diploid state (two sets of chromosomes) found in most cells in a multicellular organism. This reduction in genetic material is crucial since it allows for the re-establishment of the diploid number of chromosomes when two gametes merge to form a diploid zygote during fertilization.\nThere are two major types of gametes in animals: sperm cells in males and egg (or ova) in females. These gametes contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the offspring but are morphologically and functionally distinct. Sperm cells (or spermatozoa) are characterized by their motility, small size, and large quantities; they are produced continuously in vast numbers through a process called spermatogenesis in the male gonads or testes. Female gametes are much larger, fewer in numbers, and are not motile; they undergo a development process known as oogenesis, which takes place within the ovaries. The egg also contributes most of the cytoplasm and organelles (including mitochondria) to the zygote that are required for initial cell division stages after fertilization.\nGametes have a primary role in sexual reproduction and genetic variation, which aids in evolution. The formation of gametes involves a special type of cell division called meiosis that introduces genetic diversity via the process of recombination and independent assortment. Following the fusion of male and female gametes, the combination of paternal and maternal genetic material in the zygote allows for genetic recombination, which is a fundamental source of genetic variation and, thus, evolution. Therefore, gametes not only are critical to the inception of new individuals but also contribute to species survival and evolution." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/s41586-020-2347-0", xref="DOI:10.3389/fcell.2022.1040708", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10008/", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553142/"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nVascular associated smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are specialized cells that constitute a major component of the blood vessel wall in the circulatory system. They derive their name from the predominantly smooth appearance under microscopic examination, as opposed to the striated appearance of cardiac and skeletal muscles.  \nA principal function of VSMCs is to regulate vascular tone, which directly dictates blood pressure and blood flow distribution across various body parts. This is achieved through coordinated contraction and relaxation of the muscles in response to a variety of extracellular signals. When a blood vessel is exposed to stimuli like pressure or injury, VSMCs contract, resulting in vasoconstriction and ultimately, an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, in response to vasodilators, these cells relax, leading to vasodilation and a consequent decrease in blood pressure.\nVSMCs are also involved in vascular remodeling, a process where blood vessels adapt their structure to long-term changes in hemodynamic conditions or disease states. In diseases like atherosclerosis and hypertension, an aberrant proliferative and synthetic phenotype of VSMCs contributes to the formation of plaques, leading to vessel hardening or even occlusion. Recent research has further implicated these cells in immune responses, recognizing their function in leukocyte recruitment and inflammation, factors that are largely instrumental in vascular pathologies." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1093/cvr/cvs135", xref="DOI:10.1093/cvr/cvy023", xref="DOI:10.1161/ATVBAHA.118.311229", xref="DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2020.599415", xref="DOI:10.3390/ijms20225694"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nThe male gamete, also known as a sperm cell, is a highly specialized cell type critical to sexual reproduction. Sperm are produced during a process called spermatogenesis within the male reproductive organ, specifically the testes. They are haploid cells, carrying the genetic material from the male parent, and fuse with the ovum, the female gamete, to form a diploid zygote during fertilization, thereby initiating gestation and the development of a new organism.\nThe male gamete is distinguished by its morphology, notably its elongated shape which is geared towards locomotion. One of the primary characteristics of a male gamete is its flagellum, or tail, which propels the cell towards the female gamete. It additionally contains an elongated head region housing the nucleus, where the genetic material is stored. The anterior section of the head, the acrosome, releases enzymes essential for penetrating the protective layers of the ovum during the fertilization process.\nThe function of male gametes does not cease upon fertilization. In addition to delivering the paternal set of chromosomes, fusion of the sperm cell with the ovum causes an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ which then activates the female egg cell to undergo the so-called cortical reaction during which the egg’s zona pellucida is changed so fusion with additional sperm is prevented. The Ca2+ signal also initiates the development of the zygote and eventual formation of an embryo. Male gametes also contribute towards forming the placenta, which supplies nutrients and removes waste products during gestation." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.semcdb.2016.04.009", xref="DOI:10.1242/dev.202046", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26843/", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553142/"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nGranulosa cells are a type of somatic cell most commonly known for their crucial role within the ovarian follicles of female mammalian species. Named for their grainy appearance, they are situated in the follicular epithelium, lining the inner part of the follicle and directly surrounding the oocyte. These cells stand as an integral part of the ovarian structure and function.\nOne of the primary roles of granulosa cells is to aid in the production and secretion of sex hormones, particularly estrogen. They achieve this by working in tandem with theca cells, which stay attached to the external layer of the follicle. Theca cells produce androstenedione (a type of androgen) which granulosa cells then convert into estradiol, a form of estrogen, with the help of the enzyme aromatase. Moreover, granulosa cells participate in luteinization, transforming into luteal granulosa cells as a response to the luteinizing hormone during ovulation. This allows the formation of the corpus luteum, responsible for the secretion of progesterone necessary to maintain pregnancy.\nGranulosa cells also play a significant role in follicular development and oocyte maturation, involving close communication with the contained oocyte. They support the oocyte through the provision of nutrients and growth factors, control its meiotic cycle and ensure it is appropriately oriented and instructed for impending ovulation. Furthermore, granulosa cells contribute to the formation of the zona pellucida and the follicular fluid, providing an optimal environment for the oocyte's growth and maturation. These cells, thus, perform multiple vital roles, underscoring their importance in fertility and reproductive health." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.ejogrb.2004.01.010", xref="DOI:10.1093/humrep/del408", xref="DOI:10.1093/humupd/6.3.279", xref="DOI:10.1210/jcem-28-3-355", xref="DOI:10.3389/fendo.2019.00832/full"}

The primary role of D cells is to produce and secrete somatostatin, a potent paracrine inhibitor. \nIn the gastrointestinal tract, somatostatin slows down digestion. It reduces gastric acid secretion and slows down the rate of gastric emptying, thereby prolonging and controling the digestive p. Functionally, these effects are aimed at sustaining nutrient absorption to optimize energy extraction from consumed food.\nIn the pancreas, D cells maintain a vital role in endocrine regulation. D cells in the pancreatic islands secrete somatostatin to inhibit the release of both insulin and glucagon from type A cells and B cells, glucoregulatory hormones that control blood sugar levels. Hence, D cells contribute considerably to the homeostasis of the body's metabolic processes. It is also noteworthy that dysfunctional D cells or irregular somatostatin signaling has been associated with certain pathologies such as neuroendocrine tumors and gastric ulcers." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.pharmthera.2015.05.007", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41574-018-0020-6", xref="DOI:10.1093/annonc/mdh216", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/somatostatin-cell"}

Smooth muscle myoblasts arise from the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, a process tightly regulated by specific genetic factors and environmental signals. Their role extends to myogenesis, particularly in the formation of muscular tissue, especially during embryonic development.\nSmooth muscle myoblasts possess distinctive cellular characteristics. In contrast to skeletal muscle myoblasts, they do not fuse to create multinucleated fibers. Instead, they differentiate into individual, uninucleated smooth muscle cells. This differentiation unfolds in two distinct phases: proliferation, marked by rapid division to increase cell numbers, and differentiation, involving structural and functional transformation into mature smooth muscle cells. This intricate process is intricately mediated by various signaling molecules and transcription factors.\nFunctionally, smooth muscle myoblasts and the mature muscle cells they generate play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Smooth muscle cells orchestrate involuntary muscle responses and are integral to body systems that regulate blood flow, propel food along the digestive tract, and control airflow in the respiratory tract. These diverse functions underscore the significance of smooth muscle myoblasts in the body's growth, maintenance, and overall function." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1074/jbc.RA118.001739", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544225/", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/smooth-muscle"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nSkeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) are a type of adult stem cell that nestles on the outer surface of the myofiber, positioned between the sarcolemma (plasma membrane of the muscle cell) and peripheral basement membrane. \nThe primary function of SMSCs lies in their capacity to facilitate the growth and repair of damaged skeletal muscle. Upon muscle injury or trauma, these normally quiescent cells activate, proliferate, and differentiate into myoblasts. These myoblasts subsequently mature and fuse to form myotubes, which ultimately help in the repair and rebuilding of muscle fibers. This response is an integral part of the skeletal muscle's ability to recover from injury and adapt to enhanced or changing physical demands, thereby maintaining and improving muscle function.\nFurthermore, SMSCs also contribute to hypertrophic muscle growth due to resistance exercise and endurance training, with the notable feature of their multi-nucleated nature resulting from the fusion of differentiated myoblasts. The additional nuclei support enhanced protein synthesis, thus allowing the muscle fibers to grow and strengthen in response to exercise. In aging and in diseases, the number or functionality of these cells can decrease, leading to impaired muscle regeneration and progressive muscle weakness." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/s1357-2725(03)00042-6", xref="DOI:10.1152/physrev.00061.2017", xref="DOI:10.1186/s13287-022-02706-5", xref="DOI:10.1369/0022155411426780", xref="DOI:10.22074/cellj.2016.4714"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nAcinar cells are specialized exocrine gland cells that secrete specific enzymes and fluids to aid in digestion. Found primarily in the pancreas and salivary glands, the term acinar is derived from the Latin word 'acinus' which means 'grape'; this is because acinar cells are arranged in a grape-like cluster around small ducts, formulating an acinus structure. \nIn the salivary glands, acinar cells secrete digestive enzymes as well as other substances such as mucus and water. These secretions service the initial stages of the digestive process, preparing the consumed food for onward digestion in the stomach and intestines by lubricating and partially breaking it down. \nIn the pancreas, acinar cells are responsible for synthesizing and secreting a significant amount of digestive enzymes, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and amylase. These enzymes are stored in zymogen granules inside the acinar cells until they are dispatched into the small intestine. Once within the small intestine, they break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into substances that can be absorbed. This is vital to the effective and efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients from the food we consume. \nAcinar cells have high protein synthesis rates and are susceptible to accumulation of misfolded proteins; the subsequential induction of ER stress is thought to be involved in the development of pancreatitis, a serious inflammatory disease of the exocrine pancreas." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1007/BF00710764", xref="DOI:10.1038/nrgastro.2013.36", xref="DOI:10.1097/MOG.0b013e32832ebfac", xref="DOI:10.1111/prd.12116", xref="DOI:10.1152/physrev.00011.2011"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nPodocytes are highly specialized, terminally differentiated glomerular visceral epithelial cells that wrap around the capillaries in the kidneys. They play an essential role in kidney function, particularly in the filtration selectivity of the glomerulus. Each podocyte is characterized by a unique architecture with a large cell body, ‘major processes’ extending outwardly from the cell body and ‘foot processes’, also known as pedicels, which surround. the glomerular capillary loops\nPodocytes represent the last barrier of the glomerular filtration membrane in the kidney. This barrier prevents the leakage of plasma proteins from the blood into the urine, hence maintaining protein homeostasis in the body. The foot processes of the podocytes interdigitate with those from neighboring cells. The cell-cell junctions between the foot processes, the slit-diaphragms, are thought to create a molecular sensor of renal filtration that prevents the passage of macromolecules while allowing water and small solutes to pass.\nPodocytes also contribute to the glomerular basement membrane by secreting collagen and maintain glomerular endothelial cell fenestration by secreting VEGFA. They have been shown to play a role in inducing cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, and inflammatory response, consistent with their essential function in the kidney. \nThe importance of podocytes is further emphasized by the effects of their damage or loss. Abnormalities in podocytes often result in severe kidney diseases (podocytopathies), including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease (MCD). Injury to the podocytes can result in \"effacement\" or flattening of foot processes, leading to increased permeability of the filtration barrier and proteinuria (an excess of serum protein in urine) which is a common symptom of kidney diseases." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/s41467-022-33748-1", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41572-020-0196-7", xref="DOI:10.1146/annurev-physiol-020911-153238", xref="DOI:10.1159/000481633", xref="DOI:10.3389/fcell.2021.771931"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nFenestrated cells are specialized epithelial cells that are characterized by a distinctive structural feature, fenestrations or tiny pores, which allow an exchange of substances such as fluids, nutrients, and waste between blood vessels and the surrounding tissue environments. These cells are present in various types of epithelial tissues in the human body, including the intestinal tract, endocrine glands, and certain parts of the renal system. \nThere are multiple types of endothelial cell fenestrations. The most common type is found in systemic capillaries of the endocrine tissue (e.g., pancreatic islets), gastrointestinal mucosa, and renal peritubular capillaries. Here, the fenestrated cells have fenestrations in their peripheral cytoplasm with a unique thin and permeable diaphragm that provides a high degree of selectivity, blocking the passage of larger molecules while allowing the free movement of smaller ones. In contrast, other types of fenestrations, such as the discontinuous epithelium of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, do not have diaphragms. \nCharacteristically, fenestrated cells play a vital role in the filtering process of body systems. They are a key part of the glomeruli in the kidneys where blood is filtered under high pressure. The fenestrations present in the endothelial cells lining the capillaries of the glomerulus allow the free passage of water and small solute molecules towards the Bowman's capsule, leaving behind larger proteins and cells in the blood, thereby aiding in the filtration and waste removal process. \nIn the endocrine system, fenestrated cells in glandular capillaries allow the prompt release of hormones into the bloodstream. These cells have tightly clustered fenestrations which increase the surface area available for passive diffusion, improving the efficiency of hormone secretion. In villi of the small intestine, these cells increase absorption efficiency, permitting the exchange of water, electrolytes, and nutrients.\nOverall, fenestrated cells contribute immensely to important physiological processes of filtration, absorption, and secretion, primarily connecting our body's circulation system with the surrounding tissues and organs." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/ar.1092200109", xref="DOI:10.1016/0306-4522(86)90162-4", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.devcel.2012.11.003", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41467-022-31571-2", xref="DOI:10.1152/ajprenal.90601.2008"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nPP cells, also known as pancreatic polypeptide cells (and previously called F cells or gamma cells), are enteroendocrine cells predominantly found in the islets of Langerhans in the head of the pancreas. They are one of the four main endocrine cell types present in the pancreatic islets, along with type A, B and D cells. PP cells are notable for their production of pancreatic polypeptide, an anorexigenic hormone that modulates food intake and energy homeostasis. \nBy secreting pancreatic polypeptide, PP cells play a significant role in the management of both digestive and appetite regulation. Upon ingestion of food, there is a significant increase in the secretion of pancreatic polypeptide, which then reduces biliary secretion and helps slow down the movement of food through the digestive tract. This allows more time for digestion to take place and nutrients to be absorbed, promoting the efficient use of dietary intake. The pancreatic polypeptide further reduces appetite by interacting with the hypothalamus, the area of the brain responsible for control of hunger.\nGiven their important role in digestion, malfunction or damage to PP cells can lead to a disturbance in the digestive process and contribute to some disease conditions. For example, an overproduction of pancreatic polypeptide can result in conditions such as pancreatic tumors and diabetes. Conversely, an under secretion might contribute to obesity due to impaired dietary control. Furthermore, PP cells may also play a role in the body's energy balance, suggesting their implication in conditions related to energy metabolism." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.febslet.2014.07.005", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.mce.2015.06.028", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41580-020-00317-7", xref="DOI:10.1210/jc.2003-030630", xref="DOI:10.1369/00221554155835"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nUrothelial cells are a unique type of epithelial cell found lining the urinary tract system. They form the urothelium, a specialized, multi-layered epithelium that lines major portions of the urinary tract, including the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, and the proximal part of the urethra. The distinct characteristic of urothelial cells is their ability to stretch and contract depending on the volume of liquid they contain - a feature that facilitates the essential role they play in maintaining the functionality and integrity of the urinary system.\nThe primary function of urothelial cells is to provide an impermeable barrier to urine, preventing the toxic components present in the urine from seeping back into the body's bloodstream. The urothelium consists of a superficial umbrella cell layer, 1–2 layers of intermediate cells, and a basal cell layer. The umbrella layer is composed of large, mostly binucleated cells that are covered in an asymmetrical unit membrane, the uroplakin plaques. These plaques function to seal the apical membrane of the bladder from the toxic and highly variable contents of urine. The lipid bilayer structure of uroplakin plaques has an exceptionally high concentration of uroplakins that contribute to the barrier function of the urothelium.\nBeyond their mechanical function, urothelial cells also play a role in sensing and signaling changes in the urinary system. They express a number of sensor molecules or respond to thermal, mechanical and chemical stimuli and can release chemical mediators. This allows them to act as sensory transducers because they detect changes in the filling state of the bladder and transmit this information to the nervous system. Moreover, these versatile cells contribute to the defense mechanism against urinary tract pathogens. They respond to bacterial infections by releasing chemical messengers, cytokines and chemokines, to attract immune cells, and also can engulf pathogens via endocytosis." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/nau.22195", xref="DOI:10.1038/ki.2009.73", xref="DOI:10.1038/ncpuro0672", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41579-020-0324-0", xref="DOI:10.1152/physrev.00041.2019"}

def: "Cardiac muscle cells are striated muscle cells that are responsible for heart contraction. In mammals, the contractile fiber resembles those of skeletal muscle but are only one third as large in diameter, are richer in sarcoplasm, and contain centrally located instead of peripheral nuclei." [GOC:mtg_cardiacconduct_nov11, GOC:tfm, ISBN:0323052908, PMID:22426062, PMID:4711263]
comment: This class encompasses the muscle cells responsible for heart* contraction in both vertebrates and arthropods.  The ultrastucture of a wide range of arthropod heart cells has been examined including spiders, horseshoe crabs, crustaceans (see Sherman, 1973 and refs therein) and insects (see Lehmacher et al (2012) and refs therein).  According to these refs, the cells participating in heart contraction in all cases are transversely striated.  Insects hearts additionally contain ostial cells, also transversely striated muscle cells, but which do not participate in heart contraction.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nCardiac muscle cells, also known as cardiomyocytes or cardiac myocytes, are specialized cells that form the heart tissue. These cells are elongated, branched, and contain a single centrally located nucleus. Their anatomy is composed primarily of densely packed myofibrils, which are protein structures that consist of sarcomeres - the fundamental units of muscle contraction. Cardiac muscle cells are united at their ends through specialized junctions known as intercalated discs, which allow the heart to contract in a unified, powerful and rhythmic way.\nFunctionally, cardiac muscle cells are responsible for the heart's consistent pumping action that circulates blood throughout the body. Unlike most cells in the body, cardiac muscle cells spontaneously depolarize and generate action potentials without external stimulation. This unique trait stems from the presence of ion channels in the cells' membrane that allow a cyclic flow of ions across the membrane, which create the electrical impulses necessary for heart contraction. The spread of these electrical signals from one cardiac muscle cell to another - facilitated by the interconnected network made by the intercalated disks - results in a synchronized contraction of the heart muscle.\nUnlike skeletal muscle cells which can tire and need rest, cardiac muscle cells have to work ceaselessly throughout the entire lifespan, without the opportunity for rest, to ensure continuous circulation of blood. This is made possible through the high volume of mitochondria and a constant supply of oxygen from coronary circulation. In conclusion, cardiac muscle cells, through their unique structure and vital functionality, play a pivotal role in sustaining life by providing the means for blood to reach every cell in the body." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.ccep.2010.10.012", xref="DOI:10.1038/nrcardio.2016.203", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572070", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cardiac-muscle"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nInflammatory macrophages, also sometimes referred to as M1 or classically activated macrophages, play an important role in the inflammatory response. The M1/M2 classification is based upon macrophage polarization rather than macrophage location and refers to macrophage activation towards either a more inflammatory or more resolving phenotype, respectively, although the functional diversity of macrophages is more nuanced than such a dichotomy suggests.\nInflammatory macrophages are derived from monocytes recruited to a site of infection or injury. M1 macrophages are classically activated, typically by IFN-γ or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Upon sensing signs of inflammation, they quickly respond by increasing their pro-inflammatory activity. They achieve this by producing a range of signaling molecules, such as nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, and numerous cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1, -6 and -12. The release of these potent molecules helps to recruit other immune cells to the site, killing off pathogenic organisms and facilitation inflammation. At the same time, M1 macrophages can also present antigens to T cells, thereby helping to induce an adaptive immune response. Over time, these macrophages may transition in phenotype and function to help resolve the inflammation and promote tissue repair.\nDespite the beneficial role of inflammatory macrophages in dealing with pathogens, chronic activation of these cells can lead to harmful effects. Over time, continuous production of pro-inflammatory molecules can cause damage to tissues and organs. This is seen in certain chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, asthma, and various autoimmune disorders. In such situations, the normally protective function of inflammatory macrophages is not properly controlled, which can contribute to disease pathology." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/s41392-023-01452-1", xref="DOI:10.1186/s12935-021-02089-2", xref="DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2015.00263", xref="DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2020.583084"}

These immune cells play crucial roles in maintenance and regulation, homeostasis, and disease response, thereby helping in the overall cognitive functioning of an organism. \nThere are different macrophage populations in the CNS, often classified into microglial cells, which reside in the parenchyma, and non-parenchymal macrophages at the interface between the brain and the periphery, including the perivascular spaces, the choroid plexus, and the meninges. CNS macrophages are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. CNS macrophages have distinct morphologies: Meningeal and perivascular macrophages have a more elongated shape than microglia, which are characterized by a small cell body with fine processes; in contrast, choroid plexus macrophages typically have a stellate shape.\nMicroglia are the most abundant abundant mononuclear phagocytes and have been shown to play a number of physiological roles, including proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions, synaptic pruning and remodeling, and apoptotic cell removal through phagocytosis. Non-parenchymal CAMs primarily support the barrier function against external antigens. Meningeal macrophages have been shown to respond to peripheral microbial challenges and to protect the brain against fatal viral infection.\nCNS macrophages are also involved in the initiation and progression of many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease as well as multiple sclerosis." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1007/s00281-013-0382-8", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.immuni.2022.10.005", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.tins.2021.07.002", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41583-019-0201-x"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nBone cells, also known as osteocytes, form the building blocks of the skeletal system. They represent the most common type of bone cell, making up approximately 95% of the total bone cell population in mature adult bone tissue. Osteocytes are a stellate shape with numerous long, slender dendritic processes.\nThe formation of bone is a complex process involving the action of osteoclasts - cells that break down and reabsorb old bone, followed by osteoblasts that rebuild the bone. Osteocytes serve as coordinators for these two types of bone cells to ensure a balance in the bone remodeling process, contributing to maintaining both bone strength and mineral homeostasis.\nThe primary functions of osteocytes involve the creation, maintenance, and repair of bone tissue. They ensure that bone remodeling is performed by forming a network within the bone and communicating with other cells to help them respond to mechanical strain and damage.\nA remarkable aspect of osteocytes is their ability to perceive mechanical forces, translating them into biochemical signals that regulate bone remodeling and adaptation. Defects in osteocyte function, aside from other bone cells, have been associated with several bone disorders such as osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, and skeletal manifestations of diabetes." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1007/s00795-015-0099-y", xref="DOI:10.1007/s11914-012-0105-4", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.jot.2021.04.005", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41413-020-0099-y"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nType A enteroendocrine cells, also known as alpha cells or A cells, are a species of endocrine cells primarily located in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans; they have also been identified within the lining of the stomach. Functionally, these cells are pivotal in glucose metabolism and homeostasis, accounting for about 20% of the total population of cells in the pancreatic islets. \nThe primary role of type A enteroendocrine cells involves the synthesis, storage, and secretion of the peptide hormone glucagon, which is critical in energy regulation throughout the body. In response to a decrease in blood glucose levels, the pancreatic A cells are stimulated to secrete glucagon into the bloodstream. Glucagon acts on its target cells, mainly in the liver, to stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis processes, thereby increasing blood glucose levels back to normal. In this way, pancreatic A cells play an integral role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and preventing hypoglycemia.\nPancreatic A cells also participate in the local regulation of islet activities as glucagon acts through glucagon receptors on A, B and D type cells within the islets. Recent studies have also shown that Pancreatic A cells play a role in the generation and regeneration of B type cells. Following beta cell injuries pancreatic A cells increase in numbers and produce Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases the proliferation and cytoprotection of beta cells. In response to extreme injury of B type cells pancreatic A cells can transform (transdifferentiate) into functioning B type cells.\nUntil recently, glucagon has been considered a pancreas-specific hormone; however, extrapancreatic glucagon has been reported in patients who had undergone complete, and glucagon-positive cells been identified in the human stomach, indicating that Type A enteroendocrine cells are not restricted to the pancreas." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.diabres.2018.06.013", xref="DOI:10.1210/en.2016-1748", xref="DOI:10.2337/db15-1541", xref="DOI:10.2337/dbi19-0002", xref="DOI:10.3389/fphys.2012.00349/full"}

The electrical signals initiated and propagated in these cells are responsible for heartbeats. They also respond to the electrical signals transmitted by the autonomic nervous system and chemical signals like hormones.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nRegular atrial cardiac myocytes, also known as atrial myocytes, are specialized muscle cells found in the atria – the upper chambers of the heart. They contract and relax during the heart's cycle, modulating the pumping of blood through the atria and into the ventricles. Additionally, endowed with inherent rhythmic electrical activity, atrial myocytes contribute significantly to the initiation and propagation of the heart’s electrical impulses.\nA distinguishing feature that separates atrial myocytes from other cardiac myocytes is their ability to synthesize and secrete atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in response to atrial stretch or dilatation. ANP acts as a potent vasodilator and diuretic, helping to maintain blood pressure and volume homeostasis. The phenomena of atrial stretch or distension, which triggers ANP release, is often in response to excess blood volume entering the heart, providing a mechanism at the cellular level which actively regulates systemic cardiovascular balance.\nLike all cardiac myocytes, atrial myocytes are embedded in a dense network of connective tissue that provides structural support. These cells are characterized by a single, centrally located nucleus, and overall, have a rod-like appearance with branching ends that connect with adjacent cells to form a continuous, synchronized ensemble. Their cytoplasm is abundant with mitochondria, reflecting the high energy demand associated with constant contraction and relaxation. At the ultrastructural level, atrial myocytes display striations due to the regular arrangement of actin and myosin proteins, which facilitate the contraction process essential for the heart's pump function." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.11.025", xref="DOI:10.1111/pace.14107", xref="DOI:10.1172/JCI25417", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cardiac-muscle", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/cardiac-action-potential"}

def: "A endothelial cell of a lymphatic vessel. The border of the oak leaf-shaped endothelial cell of initial lymphatics are joined by specialized buttons. The discontinuous feature of buttons distinguishes them from zippers in collecting lymphatics, but both types of junctions are composed of proteins typical of adherens junctions and tight junctions found in the endothelium of blood vessels. Buttons seal the sides of flaps of the oak leaf-shaped endothelial cell, leaving open the tips of flaps as routes for fluid entry without disassembly and reformation of intercellular junctions."

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nEndothelial cells of lymphatic vessels are specialized type of cells that form the interior lining of the lymphatic system, which primarily comprises the lymph vessels and nodes. These cells play a critical role in creating a barrier between the lymphatic system and the surrounding tissues. They are structurally different from the endothelial cells of the blood vessels due to the presence of anchoring filaments and lack of a continuous basement membrane, and have a unique phenotype marked by the expression of various cell-specific markers such as Prox-1, VEGFR-3, and LYVE-1.\nA significant function of these endothelial cells is to maintain the fluid balance within the body. They facilitate the uptake of excess interstitial fluid that collects in the body tissues, and ensure its transport back into the bloodstream via the lymphatic vessels. These cells also enable the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system, and their subsequent transport in the form of chyle, a milky fluid, to the blood.\nFurthermore, endothelial cells of lymphatic vessels play a pivotal role in the body's immune response. They enable the passage of lymphocytes, that are crucial for the body's defense mechanism, from the tissues into the lymph where these cells are activated to fight against foreign bodies and infections. Also, they regulate inflammation reactions by controlling the migration of inflammatory cells, and are thus involved in pathological conditions with an inflammatory component. Lastly, these cells have been noted for their involvement in various disease states related to tissue edema, metastasis, and tumor growth, thus highlighting their importance in both health and disease states." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.it.2022.10.010", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41577-020-0281-x", xref="DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00036", xref="DOI:10.3389/fphys.2020.00509/full", xref="DOI:10.3892/mco.2017.1356"}

These cells have a unique, flattened shape, and are tightly bound together, forming a thin layer known as the endothelium. The endothelium is responsible for maintaining the interior surface of blood vessels, and plays a critical role in ensuring the smooth flow of blood. \nVascular endothelial cells act as a semi-permeable membrane, controlling the passage of materials and the transit of white blood cells into and out of the bloodstream. These cells are also involved in blood coagulation. When a blood vessel is damaged, endothelial cells promote clotting to prevent excessive bleeding and facilitate wound healing. Other functions include regulation of blood pressure and blood volume by releasing vasodilators and vasoconstrictors to either widen or constrict blood vessels, accordingly.\nFurthermore, the endothelial cells are crucial in the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. This is particularly important in wound healing and the growth of new tissues during development or after injury. In the context of diseases such as cancer, angiogenesis helps facilitate tumor growth by providing nutrients and oxygen." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/s41569-022-00770-1", xref="DOI:10.1186/s12872-015-0124-z", xref="DOI:10.3389/fphys.2022.863265/full", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vascular-endothelial-cell"}

comment: The marker set C1orf194, MS4A8 can identify the Human cell type ciliated columnar cell of tracheobronchial tree in the Lung with a confidence of 0.86 (NS-Forest FBeta value). {xref="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11165918"}
comment: These cells possess numerous cilia on their surface, typically ranging from 200 to 300 per cell. The cilia vary in length, measuring between 6 to 7 μm in the upper airways (trachea) and becoming shorter, around 4 μm, in the smaller airways (terminal bronchioles). These cells form a two-layered 'coat' in the airway: the lower 'sol' layer is watery, allowing the cilia to beat in coordinated waves, while the upper 'gel' layer is thick and sticky, trapping inhaled particles. {xref="PMID:25386990", xref="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-032304048-8.50071-2"}

A defining feature of these endo-epithelial cells are the tiny hair-like structures covering their surface, known as cilia. The nucleus is located at the base of the cell, and the area above it is rich in mitochondria and well-developed endoplasmic reticulum, both crucial for the energy-intensive process of cilia operation.\nThe primary function of these ciliated cells is to keep the respiratory tract clean via mucociliary clearance or the respiratory escalator. These cells create a two-layered 'coat': The lower \"sol\" layer is watery where the cilia can beat in coordinated waves, and the upper \"gel\" layer is thick and sticky, trapping inhaled particles, such as dust, bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful substances. This rhythmical beating of the cilia then moves the mucus and trapped particles upwards and out of the respiratory tract, which is then either coughed out or swallowed.\nDamage or dysfunction of these ciliated cells, as seen in diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, or chronic bronchitis, may lead to reduced or ineffective mucociliary clearance and an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1101/cshperspect.a028241", xref="DOI:10.1146/annurev-physiol-021014-071931", xref="DOI:10.1152/ajplung.00329.2019", xref="DOI:10.1159/000196486"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nBrush cells, also referred to as tuft cells or multivesicular cells, are a specialized type of epithelial cell mainly noted for their characteristic 'brush border' composed of microvilli. These cells reside in the epithelial lining of tissue organs such as the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and the bile ducts. The name derives from their distinct appearance under the microscope, which resembles a brush due to the dense layer of microvilli protruding into the lumen.\nA key function of brush cells is chemosensation: They express a variety of signaling molecules and receptors that enable them to detect specific chemical stimuli in the environment and act as sensory transducers. Many of these receptors are responsive to luminal content, which makes brush cells vital for regulating and coordinating appropriate physiological responses to changes in these substances. \nRecent research has also elucidated an important role for these cells in immunity. Intestinal brush cells have been found to be the source of a cytokine called interleukin-25, which can initiate type 2 immune responses during parasitic infections. This immune function, along with the chemosensing abilities, signifies that brush cells could serve crucial roles in health and disease, although much research is still required to fully elucidate their myriad roles in physiology and pathology. Overall, brush cells are a versatile cell type, whose distinct morphology and functional capabilities allow them to perform a unique set of functions within the body." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1007/978-3-211-99390-3_83", xref="DOI:10.1038/nature16161", xref="DOI:10.1111/j.1469-7580.2005.00403.x", xref="DOI:10.3389/fphys.2015.00087", xref="DOI:10.5114/ceji.2022.124416"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nIntestinal crypt stem cells, also known as crypt base columnar cells, are a unique type of cell, characterized by the highly specific marker LGR5, found in the intestinal epithelium. Situated at the bottom of the minute pockets known as crypts of Lieberkühn, these are undifferentiated cells that have the ability to perpetually self-renew, as well as differentiate into various other cell types that constitute the epithelial lining of the intestine. \nThe fundamental role of intestinal crypt stem cells is to provide a constant supply of new cells to maintain the cellular turnover of the intestinal epithelium, a tissue known for rapid self-renewal. These stem cells are nurtured and protected by specialized epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and together constitute the intestinal stem cell niche. \nAn important function of intestinal crypt stem cells is to sustain the balance between cell division and programmed cell death, called apoptosis, to ensure the integrity of the intestinal lining. Given their active proliferation rate, these stem cells initiate the creation of diverse differentiated cell types, including enterocytes (the primary absorptive cells in the intestinal lumen), goblet cells (that produce mucus to protect the epithelial layer), enteroendocrine cells (involved in producing gastrointestinal hormones), and Paneth cells (involved in secreting antimicrobial peptides). This diversity in output regulates the physiological activities of the gut ranging from nutrient absorption, hormone secretion, bacterial balance, to immunity.\nResearch studies suggest that dysregulation in intestinal crypt stem cell proliferation and differentiation is associated with several intestinal disorders including intestinal cancer, and various enteropathies." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.cell.2013.07.004", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41575-018-0081-y", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41580-020-0278-0", xref="DOI:10.1101/gad.1674008", xref="DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2184.2009.00642.x"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nPancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells (also called F or gamma cells) are unique endocrine cells located within the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. PP cells are one of the rarer pancreatic cell types and are more prevalent in the head and neck of the pancreas. They are critical in normal pancreatic physiological functions and are involved in the development of pancreatic endocrine disorders.\nThe primary function of PP cells is the production and secretion of the pancreatic polypeptide hormone (PP). This hormone plays a crucial role in several gastrointestinal functions and metabolic responses. The release of the PP hormone is stimulated after eating, especially in protein-rich meals, leading to it being present in large amounts during digestion. The fundamental role of PP is to self-regulate pancreatic secretion activities ensuring its exocrine and endocrine functions are under control.\nThe pancreatic polypeptide hormone from PP cells also aids in adapting to low physical activity and fasting by reducing the production of insulin and glucagon and inhibiting the hepatic glucose production. Additionally, this hormone influences gut motility by slowing down the gastric emptying and reducing small intestinal transit, thereby controlling the pace at which nutritional substances are absorbed. Because of these functions, any malfunction or irregularity in PP cells can result in various disorders such as diabetes and pancreatic diseases." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-819402-7.00001-2", xref="DOI:10.1016/B978-012369442-3/50154-9", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.mce.2015.06.028", xref="DOI:10.1038/s42255-019-0148-2", xref="DOI:10.3389/fendo.2023.1192311"}

During the early phases of embryonic development, these cells exhibit pluripotency, meaning they possess the potential to differentiate into a diverse array of specialized cell types that constitute different body tissues and structures. \nThe balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in embryonic cells is crucial for successful development. When cells continue to divide without differentiating, overgrowth may occur leading to conditions such as teratomas (tumors of embryonic cells). Conversely, if cell differentiation proceeds at the expense of cell proliferation, developmental anomalies could occur regarding size or mass of the organism or its parts." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/iub.1404", xref="DOI:10.1093/molehr/gan048", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9906/"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nThe basal epithelial cells of the tracheobronchial tree are critical components found in the lining of the airway passages, including the trachea and bronchi. They are keratin-5-positive, nonciliated, cuboidal cells and typically tightly attached to the basement membrane. In humans, the proportion of basal cells in the respiratory epithelium gradually decreases going down the tracheobronchial tree: they represent approximately 34% of the cells in the trachea, 27% in the large airways, and 10% in the small airways, although it is worth noting that there are differences in the compositions of the tracheobronchial epithelia between different species.\nBasal epithelial cells serve as the basal layer of the tracheobronchial epithelium, providing both structural and regenerative support for the epithelial tissue that lines the upper regions of the respiratory tract. They serve as progenitor or stem cells that are capable of differentiating into multiple cell types, such as ciliated and secretory cells. This gives them a central role in homeostatic maintenance of the epithelium, and in repairing damaged epithelium after an injury or during disease. This regenerative capacity is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the tracheobronchial surface, especially given its continual exposure to inhaled irritants and microorganisms. \nIn addition to their primary restorative function, basal epithelial cells are also involved in the initial immune response within the tracheobronchial tree. Equipped with pattern recognition receptors, these cells can identify and respond to pathogenic organisms, triggering an immune response and producing a range of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, to help combat infections." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1165/rcmb.2013-0049OC", xref="DOI:10.1186/s12931-014-0160-8", xref="DOI:10.2353/ajpath.2010.090870"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nEndocardial cells, often referred to as endothelial cells of the heart, constitute the innermost lining layer of the heart tissues, forming the endocardium. They play a critical role in maintaining heart functionality and homeostasis. These cells, flat and squamous in structure, are adjoined closely to form a tight barrier that separates the heart's muscular layer, the myocardium, from the blood flowing through the heart chambers.\nFunctionally, endocardial cells are key players in several crucial physiological processes within the heart. Synthesizing matrix molecules that contribute to the structural formation of the heart, these cells actively partake in maintaining its structural integrity. They also exhibit unique metabolic activity, which aids in maintaining optimal cardiac functioning in both healthy and pathological conditions. Importantly, they are known for their involvement in modulating myocardial contraction and relaxation, that is crucial for normal heart rhythm and function. They achieve this by producing factors like nitric oxide (NO) which, amongst other things, aids in the regulation of blood pressure, prevents blood clotting and inhibits the adherence of blood cells to the vessel wall.\nIn pathological states, endocardial cells can undergo a transformation process known as endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which is inherently involved in several cardiac diseases. In this transition, they acquire the ability to migrate and differentiate into several other types of cells contributing to disease progression. Moreover, their dysfunction can lead to endocarditis, an inflammation of the endocardium, as well as increase the risk of other heart diseases." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.medici.2017.08.003", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.06.033", xref="DOI:10.1101/cshperspect.a036723", xref="DOI:10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.313788", xref="DOI:10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312136"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nThe respiratory goblet cell is a highly specialized cell type found primarily within the respiratory tract, including the nose, trachea, and lungs. Named because their shape resembles a goblet - a drinking vessel with a wide body and narrow neck - these cells form a vital part of the respiratory system's protective mechanisms. They are found within the columnar epithelium lining these organs, which forms a barrier between the internal body and the exterior environment.\nA principal function of the respiratory goblet cell is the production and secretion of mucus, a carbohydrate-rich, viscous and gel-like substance that plays a critical role in trapping dust, bacteria, viruses, and other airborne particles that are inhaled. The mucus secreted by the goblet cells covers the lining of the respiratory tract, effectively catching these particles and preventing them from reaching the lungs and causing infection. Mucus also provides hydration and lubrication to the respiratory tract surfaces, which is important in maintaining the tissue's health and functioning.\nIn addition to their mucus-secreting capabilities, respiratory goblet cells also play a significant role in the body's inflammatory responses. When the respiratory system is exposed to irritants or pathogens, the number and activity of goblet cells often increase, leading to a higher production of mucus. This is a protective response designed to trap and neutralize the harmful substances more effectively. However, in conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, an overproliferation of goblet cells, also known as goblet cell hyperplasia, can lead to excessive mucus production and airway obstruction." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/S1357-2725(02)00083-3", xref="DOI:10.1111/febs.15731", xref="DOI:10.1165/ajrcmb.25.5.f218", xref="DOI:10.2147/COPD.S38938", xref="DOI:10.3109/01902148.2013.791733"}

Unless there is a consensus among anatomists that cardiocytes refer only to muscle cells, we will treat them as a general class of cells in the heart.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nEnteric smooth muscle cells are a specialized type of cell found in the gastrointestinal tract. They are an integral part of the enteric nervous system, which regulates the functions of the gastrointestinal system. These cells have a unique structural organization that enables their primary function: the contraction and relaxation necessary for the propulsion of gastrointestinal contents.\nSmooth muscle cells in the enteric system possess unique attributes that distinguish them from other smooth muscle cells in the body. One crucial function is peristalsis, where these cells contract in a coordinated manner, generating a wave of contraction and relaxation. This peristaltic movement facilitates the movement of food particles through the digestive tract, playing a vital role in the digestion and absorption processes in animals. Additionally, these cells are responsible for maintaining the tone of gastrointestinal sphincters, controlling passage and preventing one-sided movement of the contents.\nEnteric smooth muscle cells are also involved in local immune responses of the gastrointestinal tract. They can communicate with local immune cells and secrete cytokines or other signaling molecules in response to infectious organisms, which makes them crucial mediocellular players in gastrointestinal homeostasis and response to disease. Their interactions with other cell types, such as neurons, myofibroblasts, and interstitial cells of Cajal, further contribute to these cells' role in maintaining the physiological functions of the gastrointestinal system. Overall, enteric smooth muscle cells provide an indispensable contribution to the complex operations of the digestive tract." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/nrgastro.2012.168", xref="DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2982.2012.01986.x", xref="DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009644"}

They consist of spindle-shaped cells with a centrally located nucleus. These cells are rich in actin and myosin, muscle contractile proteins, that allow them to exert force and change shape. \nAortic smooth muscle cells play a vital role in maintaining blood pressure and circulation, and are essential for vascular integrity and function. The primary function of these cells is contraction and relaxation, which enables the regulation of blood flow and pressure in the aorta, and helps in the distribution of oxygen and nutrients throughout the body.\nAdditionally, a critical characteristic of smooth muscle cells is their plasticity. They can undergo phenotypic modulation in response to changes in their environment or vascular injury, switching from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. The contractile phenotype is characterized by high contractility and low proliferation rate, while the synthetic phenotype is marked by increased cell proliferation and matrix synthesis but reduced contractile function.\nAortic smooth muscle cells have a significant role in the physiological and pathological processes of the cardiovascular system. In the normal physiological state, they contribute to the elasticity and flexibility of the aorta.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nVein endothelial cells form a thin layer of squamous cells, the endothelium, lining the interior surface of veins throughout the body. They shape the inner cellular lining of the entire vascular system, including the heart, playing a crucial role in blood circulation. The unique characteristic compact arrangement of these cells enables veins to act as a barrier between the blood (that can contain foreign substances) and the surrounding venous tissue and maintain the integrity of the vascular system.\nThe primary function of vein endothelial cells is to control the exchange of substances between the bloodstream and the surrounding tissues. They facilitate selective transportation of molecules depending on their size and solubility, including gases, nutrients, hormones, and waste products. Vein endothelial cells also play a protective role by inhibiting the translocation of toxins or pathogens from blood to tissues. Additionally, these cells are involved in blood coagulation and inflammation response, primarily by producing substances that inhibit blood clot formation under normal conditions and initiating clotting when necessary.\nAnother significant function of vein endothelial cells is the regulation of blood flow and blood pressure. They produce and release several substances, including nitric oxide and prostacyclin, which help in controlling vasodilation and vasoconstriction, thereby regulating blood pressure. These cells are also responsible for angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which is crucial during wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue.

comment: A myelinating Schwann cell wraps around a single axon. Myelination occurs in larger diameter axons, while a process called ensheathment occurs on smaller diameter axons in which a single cell wraps around multiple small, unmyelinated axons separating them with a thin layer of cytoplasm. The structure formed is called a Remak bundle. {xref="PMID:16807057"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nSchwann cells, also known as neurolemmocytes, are a type of glial cell located in the peripheral nervous system. These cells play a significant role in the healthy functioning of nerves by producing myelin, a fatty substance that forms a coating around nerve fibers. Myelin serves as an insulator and enhances the speed and efficiency of electrical nerve impulses; a single Schwann cell can myelinate a single axon. Myelination starts by the elongation and envelopment of the Schwann cell around the axon, followed by the synthesis and deposition of myelin layers. Some studies suggest that Schwann cells may regulate neuronal action potential, muscular contraction, and the sensitive response. \nWhile Schwann cells are most commonly known for the formation of the myelin sheath, some Schwann cells do not form myelin: Remak Schwann cells, a class of nonmyelinating Schwann cells, ensheath axons with smaller diameter, such as C fiber nociceptors in sciatic nerves and form Remak bundles.\nSchwann cells are found along both motor and sensory neurons and are crucial for the advancement and recovery of peripheral nerve injuries, due to their capacity to support nerve regeneration. In cases of nerve injury, Schwann cells play a vital role in recovery by initiating Wallerian degeneration, a process in which the part of the axon distal to the injury site degrades and is then cleared away. Following this, Schwann cells can guide the regrowth of the nerve, providing a conducive environment for axon regeneration. They remodel themselves into a regenerative phenotype, proliferate, and organize themselves into bands of Büngner that provide physical and chemical guidance for the regrowths of axons. This function of Schwann cells in the repair and regeneration of nervous system highlights their therapeutic potential in peripheral nerve injury treatments." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/glia.23892", xref="DOI:10.1016/B978-0-444-52902-2.00005-9", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.biocel.2006.05.007", xref="DOI:10.1186/1742-2094-8-110", xref="DOI:10.1186/s13064-020-00140-y"}

These pigment-laden cells are highly specialized and perform an array of metabolic and transport functions essential for the maintenance of the photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) in the retina. The pigmentation of RPE cells actively aids in the absorption of excess light and the prevention of light scattering, thus enhancing the eye's optical properties.\nThe retinal pigment epithelium forms a key part of the blood/retina barrier. The cells have long sheet-like microvilli on their apical membrane that project into the light-sensitive outer segments of the photoreceptors, forming a close structural interaction. The basolateral membrane of the RPE interacts with the underlying Bruch’s membrane, which separates the RPE cells from fenestrated endothelium of the choriocapillaris. \nRPE cells support the photoreceptor by providing them with oxygen and nutrients (such as glucose, retinol and fatty acids) and removing waste products. They also recycle the visual pigment, in a process called the \"visual cycle\", where the RPE cells play a vital role in the regeneration of visual pigment (11-cis retinol) following the absorption of light. This is essential for the maintenance of photoreceptor excitability.\nBeyond this, RPE cells take part in the phagocytosis process, where they digest the shed ends of photoreceptor outer segments, thus, preventing the build-up of waste residue that could otherwise harm retinal health. They also secrete various factors, including growth factors required to maintain the structural integrity of choriocapillaris endothelium and photoreceptors, as well as immunosuppressive factors that play an important role in establishing the immune privilege of the eye." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1111/febs.16018", xref="DOI:10.1152/physrev.00021.2004", xref="DOI:10.3389/fphar.2021.727870/full", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/retinal-pigment"}

These bronchi are tubular structures that function to carry air from the trachea into the lungs. As part of the smooth muscle tissue, bronchial smooth muscle cells are involuntary cells, meaning they function with minimal direct voluntary control. They are characterized by their elongated spindle-shaped structure, with each cell containing a single central nucleus.\nThe primary function of bronchial smooth muscle cells is to control airway diameter, which directly influences the flow of air into and out of the lungs. Muscular contractions and relaxations mediated by these cells enable the bronchi to constrict or expand, facilitating the regulation of respiratory airflow. Additionally, these cells play a pivotal role in immune responses as they produce and release various substances that can instigate or lessen inflammation of airway tissue. Furthermore, bronchial smooth muscle cells can proliferate and lay down collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins, contributing to the structural integrity of the bronchial tubes.\nIn pathological conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the function and biology of bronchial smooth muscle cells change. Asthma, for example, is associated with an abnormal increase in the mass of the bronchial smooth muscles, leading to narrowing of the airways and resultant breathing difficulties.

Microglial cells serve as the primary immune defense mechanism within the CNS, playing active roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and responding to pathological processes. In response to pathogens and injuries, microglial cells mature and change their morphology from a ramified shape with small processes (normal state) to an amoeboid shape (mature state).\nMature microglial cells possess multiple functional abilities, thereby enabling them to execute diverse roles in order to maintain the health of surrounding neural cells. They act to clear away cellular debris, dead neurons, or plaque formations through the process of phagocytosis. They are also continuously scanning their environment and are able to detect subtle changes in the neural landscape caused by injury, disease, or infection. Upon detection of such changes, these cells become activated and present antigens and secrete cytokines and chemokines to initiate an inflammation response, which sustains the brain’s defense against injurious agents.\nTheir role is not solely destructive or defensive: mature microglial cells also contribute to neurodevelopment by guiding the formation of neural circuits, synaptogenesis, and remodeling. Furthermore, they assist in managing synaptic plasticity, a key process in learning and memory functions. While the dysregulation of microglial cells has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, they are also regarded as potential therapeutic targets for such conditions, given their crucial roles in maintaining CNS health." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1111/j.1745-7254.2007.00625.x", xref="DOI:10.1111/jnc.15689", xref="DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2022.997786", xref="DOI:10.4103/1673-5374.226386", xref="DOI:10.4103/1673-5374.322423"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nRespiratory basal cells are highly specialized cells that serve a crucial role in the human airway epithelium, predominantly found lining the surfaces of the trachea and bronchi. These cells exhibit a distinctive columnar shape and are attached directly to the basal lamina. They are characterized by the presence of high amounts of cytoplasmic keratins, predominantly keratin 5 and 14, and transcription factor tumor protein (tp63), which set them apart from other types of lung epithelial cells such as ciliated cells and secretory cells. \nBasal cells are essential for maintaining airway integrity. They make up one third of all respiratory epithelial cells and serve as stem cells as they can transform into different cell types, like goblet cells, ciliated cells, and club cells, when needed for homeostatic maintenance of the epithelial barrier or to repair and restore a healthy cellular environment after injury.\nTheir position at the interface between the internal environment and the external atmosphere makes these cells a first line of defense against air-borne irritants, allergens, and pathogens. Their robust, intrinsic reparative properties facilitate effective recovery from such adversities. However, damage to respiratory basal cells or abnormalities in their function are associated with several respiratory pathologies such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Therefore, understanding these cells' function, and their role in disease, is crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies for respiratory disorders." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1186/s12931-022-02042-5", xref="DOI:10.3389/falgy.2021.787128", xref="DOI:110.1038/s41385-020-00370-7"}

The process is tightly controlled by different growths factors: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor acts on endothelial cells, inducing them to become endothelial tip cells that initiate sprouting. After sprouting initiation, activation of Notch signaling suppresses differentiation toward a tip cell phenotype and some of the endothelial cells differentiate into stalk cells, which follow tip cells, multiply, and elongate to provide a structural backbone to the growing vessel sprout. \nIn contrast to endothelial tip cells, which migrate and lead the angiogenic sprout, endothelial stalk cells behind the sprouts continue forming the tube or lumen for blood flow and facilitate maturation and stability of the new vessel. The delicate balance between the activities of stalk and tip cells during angiogenesis is crucial to build a functional vascular network. Dysfunctions in endothelial stalk cells can lead to pathological conditions such as impaired wound healing, unregulated tumor growth, and metastasis due to abnormal angiogenesis." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1007/s12079-019-00511-z", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.cmet.2013.08.001", xref="DOI:10.1101/cshperspect.a006569", xref="DOI:10.3389/fcell.2021.642352"}

They can be classified into two functional classes - extrinsic and intrinsic muscle cells. \nThe extrinsic tongue muscle cells originate outside the tongue and are primarily involved in determining the position of the tongue within the mouth. Muscle groups such as the genioglossus, hyoglossus, and styloglossus are composed of these extrinsic muscle cells and grant the tongue its wide range of motion.\nThe intrinsic tongue muscle cells, on the other hand, originate and function within the tongue itself, influencing the shape of the tongue during speech, eating, and swallowing. These cells can contract to alter the tongue's shape, making it long, short, curled, or flat, as needed. Together, these two types of muscle cells allow the tongue to perform its vital functions effectively. Moreover, they play a critical role in maintaining oral health by facilitating physical cleaning of the oral cavity and assisting in the mechanical breakdown of food." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/ca.21011", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507782/", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554405/"}

These cells play crucial roles in maintaining ion and acid-base homeostasis. Ionocytes demonstrate remarkable plasticity and are able to adapt themselves in response to changes in environmental conditions such as pH, salinity, ion concentration, and temperature.\nThese cells work by selectively absorbing specific ions from the environment, thus maintaining the body's internal ionic balance. The most commonly absorbed ions include sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca2+), and hydrogen (H+). Moreover, ionocytes contribute to acid-base regulation. In response to acidosis or alkalosis, ionocytes can either excrete or retain hydrogen (H+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions to readjust the blood pH. Further, experimental evidence suggests a functional complexity of ionocytes, implying diverse roles beyond ion regulation. Recent research highlights ionocytes' involvement in ammonia excretion and the regulation of extracellular fluid volume, highlighting their contribution to the overall homeostatic process.\nMalfunctioning ionocytes have been implicated in various diseases, including cystic fibrosis which is caused by mutations in the chloride channel CFTR, an ionocyte marker." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.jcf.2019.09.010", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41586-018-0393-7", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41598-023-30603-1", xref="DOI:10.1146/annurev-pathol-042420-094031", xref="DOI:10.3389/fmars.2020.00709"}

In the respiratory system, they line the airways and orchestrate the coordinated movement of mucus, effectively clearing the airways of inhaled particles and pathogens. These cells are also vital in the ventricular system of the brain where they facilitate cerebrospinal fluid circulation, thus contributing to the maintenance of the brain's microenvironment. In the fallopian tube, multi-ciliated epithelial cells aid in the transport of oocytes from the ovary to the uterus, a process crucial to reproduction.\nThe formation and function of multi-ciliated epithelial cells is a highly regulated process that involves several stages of development including cell specification, centriole multiplication, and ciliogenesis.

These clusters of cells constitute only about 1% of the pancreatic islet cell population, making them a relatively small yet significant component of the pancreas.  Pancreatic epsilon cells have a round or ovoid shape with occasional cytoplasmic extensions and are characterized by small and spherical granules. \nThe principal function of pancreatic epsilon cells involves the synthesis and release of the hormone ghrelin, a peptide hormone predominantly produced in the stomach; pancreatic epsilon cells are one of the few sites outside the gastrointestinal tract known to produce this hormone. Ghrelin has multiple vital roles, playing a significant part in generating hunger sensations, promoting fat storage, and influencing various metabolic processes. It also stimulates the release of Growth Hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland.\nDuring fetal development, when they form a layer around the islet, epsilon cells are an important source of ghrelin, likely secreting the hormone into the circulation; their numbers decrease in adults. While research on pancreatic epsilon cells is still ongoing, these cells have been implicated in several disease states, most notably Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nPreosteoblast is a critical cell type involved in bone formation, crucial in a process known as ossification or osteogenesis. They are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and are an intermediate stage marking the transition from an osteoprogenitor cell to a fully differentiated osteoblast. The presence of preosteoblasts signifies the site of new bone deposition, highlighting their crucial role in skeletal development and in response to bone injury repairs.\nThe primary function of preosteoblasts is to differentiate into osteoblasts, which are responsible for secreting osteoid (the unmineralized portion of bone matrix) and regulating the process of bone mineralization. Preosteoblasts are regulated by various growth factors and hormones, including bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and Vitamin D.\nHowever, the function of preosteoblasts is not limited to bone formation alone. In addition to osteogenesis, preosteoblasts significantly contribute to the maintenance of bone homeostasis through regulating the activity of osteoclasts - the cells responsible for bone resorption. This regulation is mediated through RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway signaling. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) released from the preosteoblasts acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL impairing osteoclast formation, hence preventing excessive bone resorption. This regulatory role indicates the dual functionality of preosteoblasts, which are indispensable for both the formation of new bone and the maintenance of existing bone tissue." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/srep32884", xref="DOI:10.1096/fba.2020-00058", xref="DOI:10.1210/endo.141.9.7634", xref="DOI:10.12659/MSMBR.901142"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nThe enteroendocrine cell of the small intestine is a specialized type of cell that forms part of the lining of the intestinal wall. These cells are interspersed among absorptive cells, mucus-secreting goblet cells, and other gut cell types, forming the crypt-villus axis, which is the functional unit of the small intestinal epithelium. \nFunctionally, enteroendocrine cells play a pivotal role in the gut-endocrine system, which is responsible for the digestive process. These cells translate the luminal nutrient status into hormonal signals thereby acting as chemosensors. They contain secretory granules at their base which release hormones into the bloodstream following chemo-sensation. The hormones they secrete perform diverse functions including regulating gastric secretion, gut motility, insulin release, appetite control and other local and systemic effects. \nIn addition to their endocrine functions, enteroendocrine cells also play a part in the modulation of the immune response in the gut.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nColon macrophages are a heterogeneous population of macrophages in the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal macrophages represent the largest group of macrophages in the body and play a key role as sentinels for pathogen recognition and elimination. Because the gastrointestinal tract is continually exposed to a high antigenic load derived from microbes and food intake, macrophages in the intestines are crucial not only for the gut’s immune defense but also for maintaining gastrointestinal homeostasis, avoiding chronic inflammation despite constantly facing foreign antigens. The phenotypic profiles and cytokine production of intestinal macrophages therefore differ from conventional macrophages elsewhere in the body. \nColon macrophages orchestrate a wide variety of immune responses. They interact with the colon’s microflora thanks to their location in the mucosal layer, thus playing an important role in shaping gut immunity. By presenting antigens, they help to activate and steer an appropriate immune response either by triggering inflammation against harmful pathogens or by supporting tolerance for beneficial microbes. Therefore, disturbances in the colon macrophage population is thought to contribute to colon-related diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. \nThese immune cells are versatile and multifunctional, not just limited to defensive actions. Colon macrophages interact with the enteric nervous system to regulate gut secretion and motility. They also play a crucial role in maintaining colon tissue health and integrity by contributing to tissue repair processes. This occurs either through phagocytosis of dead cells and remnants, or indirectly through the release of growth factor molecules, which stimulate cellular proliferation and differentiation necessary for tissue regeneration." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.immuni.2022.08.005", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.jcmgh.2021.08.021", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41575-019-0172-4", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41575-023-00769-0"}

They are specialized secretory epithelial cells that are recognized by their characteristic ‘goblet’ or flask-like shape and typically have a distinctive appearance due to the accumulation of secretory vesicles in their cytoplasm.\nThe primary function of goblet cells is the secretion of mucus, which is an essential substance for the protection and successful functioning of the intestinal tract. In the colon, goblet cells continuously renew the inner mucus layer, which is attached and impervious to bacteria (the outer layer of the colon is unattached and is the habitat of commensal bacteria)\nThe mucus secreted by goblet cells is rich in glycoproteins known as mucins, especially MUC2, forming a complex web of molecules that comprises the foundational structure of the mucus layer. It traps and eliminates harmful bacteria, while selectively allowing beneficial microbiota to access the epithelial surface and aid in digestion and nutrient absorption. The mucus layer not only provides a provides a protective barrier against pathogen invasion, as well as mechanical damage, and the erosive effects of digestive enzymes, it also acts as a lubricant to facilitate the passage of food material.\nColon goblet cells are also involved in regulating the local immune response within the gut, maintaining the delicate balance between necessary immune reactions to harmful pathogens and tolerance to beneficial microbiota and dietary substances. Goblet cells can modulate immune responses by presenting antigens to dendritic cells, as well as through the production of immunomodulatory molecules that can alter the behavior of immune cells. When the inner mucus layer of the colon is defective, it might be a pathophysiological mechanism for colitis and infectious diseases." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/mi.2015.32", xref="DOI:10.1038/mi.2016.132", xref="DOI:10.1038/nrgastro.2013.35", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41385-018-0039-y", xref="DOI:10.1073/pnas.1006451107"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nTuft cells, also often referred to as brush cells or caveolated cells, are highly specialized sensory cells found in the colon, among other organs. They were named for their unique appearance under an electron microscope, which presents a distinctive ‘tuft-like’ morphology. They are characterized by apical microvilli, arranged in an irregular tuft that confers a dome-like shape. These cells comprise only a small fraction of the cells in the epithelial layer of the colon, making them among the least populous cell types in this region.\nTuft cells in the colon primarily function as chemosensory cells that can sense and respond to environmental changes. These cells can detect and respond to microbial metabolites, helping initiate immune responses against potential threats. \nRecent studies have revealed that tuft cells play a role in responding to intestinal parasitic infections. When a gastrointestinal parasite infects the colon, tuft cells are activated and release the cytokine IL-25. This action increases the production of tuft cells and triggers essential Th2 immune responses to expel the parasites. Also, the removal of tuft cells has been linked to increased susceptibility to these infections. However, overactivity of tuft cells has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting the need for a delicate balance of tuft cell function to maintain colon homeostasis." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1152/ajpgi.00073.2017", xref="DOI:10.1371/journal.ppat.1010318", xref="DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2022.822867"}

They support the vascular changes during the reproductive cycle, particularly the spiral arteriolar development and function, essential in endometrial thickening, maturation, and eventual shedding during menstruation periods. The cells also contribute to angiogenesis, a process crucial during implantation and placenta development, whereby new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels to supply the growing fetus with oxygen and nutrients.

Cardiac endothelial cells release nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator that regulates blood vessel dilation consequently controlling blood pressure and flow. They also produce a myriad of growth factors that aid in new blood vessel formation, known as angiogenesis, crucially needed for tissue repair and regeneration when the heart undergoes damage, as in cases of myocardial infarction.\nFurthermore, cardiac endothelial cells control the passage of nutrients, hormones, and gases between the bloodstream and the heart tissue, ensuring its complex metabolic demands are met adequately. They serve as a selective barrier, regulating the transit of cells and signaling molecules, thereby playing a pivotal role in inflammatory responses and immune cell trafficking.

These cells are unique among body cells, as they are transparent and filled with a clear protein called crystallin to facilitate the passage of light.\nThe entire life cycle of a lens fiber cell includes differentiation from lens epithelial cells, which are the progenitor cells lying at the anterior surface of the lens. In response to various signals, these cells elongate and migrate towards the posterior pole, while simultaneously undergoing a process of denucleation and degradation of cellular organelles. This unique process ensures that the cells do not scatter light, which is critical for the transparency of the lens. After reaching full maturity, lens fiber cells form tightly packed layers, known as laminae, to make up the distinctive architecture of the ocular lens. \nLens fiber cells play pivotal roles in vision. Their primary function is to transmit and focus the light that enters the eye onto the retina, providing the sharpness and clarity necessary for vision. The precise alignment and organization of these cells allow for optimal light transmittance and minimizes scattering, thereby maintaining the transparency of the lens.

SMFs are integral components of the dynamic and complex microenvironment of muscle tissue, contributing significantly to healthy muscle development and homeostasis.\nSMFs primarily synthesize and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as collagen, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. The resulting ECM exhibits mechanical properties that resist tensile forces from muscle contractions, ensuring muscle efficiency. It also crucially transmits force during muscle movement, aids muscle attachment to the skeletal structure, and serves as a scaffold for muscle regeneration and repair. \nFollowing injury, they proliferate and transform into myofibroblasts, aiding wound contraction and depositing new ECM for tissue repair. Additionally, these fibroblasts modulate inflammatory responses by secreting cytokines and interact with other cell types, like immune cells and satellite cells, to coordinate muscle healing.

As a significant component of the placenta, the chorion forms the external fetal-maternal interface and consists primarily of chorionic trophoblast cells. These cells are pivotal in embryogenesis, fetal nutrition, waste removal, and immune response generation, contributing crucially to the success of pregnancy.\nChorionic trophoblast cells undergo trophoblast differentiation, giving rise to specialized sub-types: cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Cytotrophoblasts, found in the inner layer, serve as stem cells and contribute to proliferative activities. In contrast, syncytiotrophoblasts, originating from cytotrophoblasts, form the outer layer with a distinctive multinucleated, continuous, and non-proliferative structure. These cells play a key role in maternal-fetal gas and nutrient exchange, producing essential hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), progesterone, and estrogen, vital for sustaining pregnancy.\nApart from their physiological roles, chorionic trophoblast cells play a crucial role in shielding the fetus from the maternal immune system. They accomplish this by modifying the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which are self-identifying proteins utilized by the immune system to identify foreign cells. Through selective expression of specific types of these molecules, trophoblast cells can evade cytotoxic T cells that might otherwise attack them, while still retaining the ability to attract natural killer cells. These natural killer cells assist in trophoblast invasion and the remodeling of blood vessels in the uterus." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1007/s00018-019-03104-6", xref="DOI:10.1093/biolre/ioy070", xref="DOI:10.1155/2014/579279", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53245/", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/placenta-development"}

Discovered through novel mapping techniques in 2018, these cells are surprisingly rare, making up less than 2% of the cells in the lung's airway, yet they play an essential role in the airway surface liquid and mucus regulation, a crucial factor in lung health.\nThe main responsibility of the pulmonary ionocyte pertains to the regulation and mobilization of chloride ions. They express a high level of CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene, which encodes a protein channel across the membrane of cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, tears, and digestive enzymes. The activity of CFTR regulates the movement of chloride ions and fluids in and out of cells, which helps maintain a balance of fluid in the organs they are expressed in. If CFTR is dysfunctional, it can cause conditions such as cystic fibrosis, characterized by thick, sticky mucus that can clog the lungs and obstruct the pancreas, leading to respiratory and digestive issues.\nThe discovery of this cell type offers new doors to the treatment and further understanding of diseases like cystic fibrosis. Increased understanding of pulmonary ionocytes could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to manipulate the function of CFTR in the lungs and other organs affected by dysfunctional CFTR." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/s41586-018-0393-7", xref="DOI:10.1146/annurev-pathol-042420-094031", xref="DOI:10.1172/JCI171268"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nLung goblet cells are critical components of the respiratory tract, specifically found in the bronchial segments. They are secretory epithelial cells known for their signature \"goblet\" or cup-like shape. Their primary function is to produce and secrete mucus that aids in trapping airborne particles and pathogens, preventing them from reaching the delicate environment of the lung. As part of the lung's epithelial lining, they act as frontline defenders, maintaining lung health and function.\nThe lung goblet cells are densely packed with granules containing mucin glycoproteins, the primary component of mucus. As mucus is produced and secreted, it moves towards the lumen of the lungs where the cilia, hair-like structures of the neighboring ciliated epithelial cells, help to navigate it upwards and out of the respiratory tract. This coordinated action ensures the expulsion of unwanted particles and pathogens, effectively cleaning the respiratory tract.\nDysfunction or abnormal proliferation of lung goblet cells can result in pathological conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and asthma, where excessive mucus production leads to airway obstruction. Furthermore, lung goblet cells respond to a variety of stimuli, including toxins, allergens, irritants, and infections, adjusting their mucus production accordingly." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/s41385-018-0039-y", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41385-020-00370-7", xref="DOI:10.1159/000512268", xref="DOI:10.1513/AnnalsATS.201802-128AW", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553208/"}

The small intestine represents a significant part of the digestive system and plays a crucial role in the absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream.\nSmooth muscle cells of the small intestine are predominantly responsible for creating the contractions and relaxations that constitute intestinal motility. They trigger these movements in a coordinated and rhythmic manner known as peristalsis and segmentation. Peristalsis is a form of longitudinal and sequential contraction that pushes food from the upper gastrointestinal tract to the lower parts. Segmentation works by squeezing the intestine randomly, thereby facilitating the mixing of food particles and increasing contact with absorptive surfaces. These two processes are critical for intestinal motility and an effective digestive process.\nApart from facilitating transit of food through contractions, these smooth muscle cells play a role in controlling the diameter of the vessels and the blood flow in the small intestine by their constrictive ability. These smooth muscle cells also contribute to the structural integrity of the small intestine by forming a part of its muscularis externa and muscularis mucosae.

They produce a variety of antimicrobials and are tightly packed to prevent infiltration between cells, forming an integral part of the body's innate immune system.\nIn addition to their protective role, these cells are involved in the secretion of mucus.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nThe large intestine goblet cell is a highly specialized type of mucosal epithelial cell that is located within the epithelial lining of the large intestine. The key function of goblet cells is the production and secretion of a protective layer of mucus which is essential for maintaining gut homeostasis. Goblet cells have a characteristic 'goblet-like' shape, which adapts them for this specific function: organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, ER, and Golgi apparatus are located in the basal portion of the cell; while the vesicles with mucins (required for mucus production) are located apically, close to the apical membrane where their exocytosis takes place.\nThe goblet cells of the large intestine produce a thick layer of mucus that coats the intestinal lumen. This mucus provides a barrier that prevents the direct contact of intestinal cells with bacteria and other potentially toxic substances present in the digestive tract. It also lubricates the intestine to facilitate the smooth passage of digested food material. It is worth noting that the mucus system differs between the small and large intestine: although in both the mucus is built around MUC2 mucin polymers produced by goblet cells, it is becoming clear that there are several types of goblet cells that function in different ways. \nFrom an immunological perspective, large intestine goblet cells participate in promoting a balanced gut immune response. They contribute to the process known as immune tolerance, where they prevent the body's immune system from overreacting to the trillions of bacteria present in the gut. These cells achieve this by secreting molecules that help maintain a calm environment, limiting inflammatory reactions unless absolutely necessary. Any dysfunction or decrease in the number of goblet cells can result in a compromised intestinal barrier leading to various health issues, including inflammatory bowel disease." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/mi.2015.32", xref="DOI:10.1042/BSR20201471", xref="DOI:10.1111/imr.12182", xref="DOI:10.1146/annurev-physiol-021115-105447", xref="DOI:full/10.1111/febs.15731"}

They are a key component of the tracheobronchial epithelium, a critical region responsible for maintaining open airways and preventing the ingress of harmful particles or irritants. Goblet cells are filled with membrane-bound secretory granules, which are responsible for their distinctive, goblet-like shape.\nGoblet cells specialize in the production and secretion of mucus, a slimy substance composed primarily of glycoproteins (mucins) and water. This sticky mucus serves to trap foreign particles and pollutants, such as dust, bacteria, and viruses that an organism breathes in. After trapping these particles, the cilia on neighboring ciliated epithelial cells beat synchronously, forming a coordinated escalator to push mucus upwards toward the pharynx, where it's either swallowed or expectorated.

These cells play a critical role in absorbing water, electrolytes, and certain vitamins from the food material passed on from the small intestine. With a unique structure of finger-like protrusions referred to as microvilli, the enterocytes increase their surface area for effective absorption.

Enterocytes of the colon facilitate this process effectively through absorption of water.\nEnterocytes are known for their high regeneration potential, replenishing every 4-5 days, enabling the healthy functioning of the colon. They originate from stem cells located in the crypt of the colon and differentiate into mature enterocytes as they migrate upwards towards the luminal surface. This constant turnover aids in maintaining the intestinal barrier, preventing the entry of detrimental substances into the systemic circulation. Their tight junctions with other epithelial cells provide a robust barrier against invasive pathogens.\nEnterocytes of the colon are involved in the communication with the gut microbiota. These cells harbor enzymes necessary for the metabolism of short-chain fatty acids, which are the byproducts of the fermentation process by gut bacteria.

They are at the forefront of sensations and responses to mechanical stimuli, like shear stress and blood pressure changes. An additional key function pertains to the production of nitric oxide, which helps to regulate vascular tone and blood pressure, prevents platelet aggregation, limits leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. These varied but connected functions help to preclude the development of atherosclerosis, ensuring normal circulation and arterial health.\nMoreover, these cells play a pivotal role in inflammation and coagulation processes. During inflammatory events, they express various adhesion molecules, aiding in leukocyte recruitment and rolling onto the vessel walls for immune response.

These cells form a ring around the iris, the eye's colored part. Ciliary muscle cells fall into the category of smooth muscle cells, characterized by their lack of the striations typical of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Their shape is elongated and pointed at both ends, and they occur in multi-nucleated syncytia where many cells share the same cytoplasm.\nCiliary muscle cells primarily control the eye's accommodation, adjusting the thickness and curvature of the lens to fine-tune the focus of light on the retina. When ciliary muscle cells contract, tension on the zonular fibers holding the lens in place is reduced, allowing the lens to become thicker and increase its refractive power. Conversely, when the ciliary muscle cells relax, the tension on the zonular fibers increases, causing the lens to become flatter and decrease its refractive power. This adjustment facilitates clear vision at different distances, ranging from near to far objects.\nAdditionally, ciliary muscle cells play a role in draining the eye's aqueous humor, which is the clear fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye between the cornea and the lens. By controlling the shape of the surrounding trabecular meshwork through muscle contractions and relaxations, ciliary muscle cells indirectly regulate intraocular pressure, a factor critical for preventing ocular conditions like glaucoma." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/S1350-9462(98)00011-1", xref="DOI:10.1038/srep31171", xref="DOI:10.1111/j.1444-0938.2008.00260.x", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ciliary-muscle"}

Each kidney holds approximately one million nephrons, each of which is composed of several distinct parts, including the renal corpuscle, the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal tubule. All sections are lined with highly specialized epithelial cells adapted to perform different functions within the sections of the nephron. \nThe different epithelial cells of the nephron play crucial roles in the process of filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion, essential tasks for the regulation of body fluid composition and volume. During filtration, the blood is forced through the walls of glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule, where waste products, electrolytes, and water are separated from the blood cells and proteins. As the filtrate then passes through the nephron, epithelial cells of the tubular portion reabsorb useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes, along with most of the water back into the bloodstream. Waste products like urea and creatinine, as well as excess ions and water, remain in the tubule for elimination.\nIn addition, epithelial cells of the nephron also play a vital part in maintaining the body's acid-base balance by actively secreting hydrogen ions into the urine while reabsorbing bicarbonate from the urine back into the blood. They are also involved in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and contribute to erythrocyte production by releasing the hormone erythropoietin in response to low oxygen levels in the blood.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nKidney collecting duct epithelial cells are a specialized type of cells that form an integral part of the renal system. Located in the collecting duct system of the kidneys, these cells are responsible for one of the final steps in the process of urine formation, and they are instrumental in the fine tuning of the volume and composition of urine by reabsorbing water and certain solutes back into the bloodstream.\nThese cells express specific channels and carriers that actively and passively transport ions and water. They also have channels on their membranes, such as sodium channels and potassium channels, involved in reabsorbing or secreting these electrolytes depending upon the body's needs. The function of renal collecting duct epithelial cells can be regulated by a variety of hormones, including vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), which can modulate the ion channels and carriers and hence indirectly influence body fluid homeostasis.\nAside from their function in ion and water balance, kidney collecting duct epithelial cells also aid in maintaining the body's acid-base balance. They have specialized functionality to secret hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen, which contributes to acid excretion. Any dysfunction may have serious implications and lead to various renal or systemic diseases, exemplifying the importance of these cells in maintaining overall body homeostasis." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.01.014", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.semnephrol.2019.04.005", xref="DOI:10.2215/CJN.05760513", xref="DOI:10.2215/CJN.08880914"}

Located in the basal layer of the epidermis, melanocytes serve as a natural sunscreen, protecting skin cells from harmful UV radiation. Structurally dendritic, they synthesize melanin through melanogenesis, transferring melanosomes to keratinocytes for UV shielding\nBeyond pigmentation and UV protection, melanocytes play roles in immune and inflammatory responses. They respond to environmental changes, communicate with skin cell types, and secrete cytokines and growth factors influencing skin homeostasis.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nCholangiocytes, also known as biliary epithelial cells, are specialized epithelial cells that line the biliary tract, which constitutes the gall bladder and bile ducts inside the liver. Crucial to the maintenance of the liver's health and function, cholangiocytes have a key role in the modification and secretion of bile, a fluid produced by hepatocytes that is essential to digestion and the absorption of fats and vitamins.\nCholangiocytes accomplish their primary function through the expression of a variety of transport proteins located on their apical and basolateral membranes, which propel bile acids and other contents of the bile into the biliary lumen. The hepatic bile, once secreted by the hepatocytes, is further modified by cholangiocytes via secretion and absorption processes. These processes help in the regulation of bile volume and composition, which is fundamental in ensuring the efficient digestion of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins and the excretion of cholesterol.\nIn addition to their role in bile modification, cholangiocytes also perform several other integral functions. For instance, these cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which allow cholangiocytes to initiate an immune response against pathogens in the biliary lumen. When functioning normally, these cells contribute to biliary integrity, hepatic architecture, and overall hepatic physiology. However, when they become pathological, they are involved in the progression of liver diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma – the malignancy of the biliary tract." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.jcmgh.2015.05.005", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.jhep.2012.10.011", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41575-019-0125-y", xref="DOI:10.1152/ajpgi.00227.2012", xref="DOI:10.5009/gnl16033"}

comment: Like smooth muscle, a glomerular mesangial cell is contractile and possesses the filaments actin and myosin. The contractile mechanism is also similar to that of smooth muscle, with Ca2+/calmodulin-activated myosin light-chain kinase instigating myosin-actin cross-bridge cycling. Mesangial cell phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils involves a novel CD36-independent, alpha(v)beta3/TSP-mediated mechanism that is uncoupled from chemokine secretion, emphasizing the injury-limiting potential of mesangial cell phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. {xref="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.1998.78.3.723", xref="PMID:9127003"}

The epithelial cells lining the connecting tubule are crucial for the journey of filtrate before it empties into urine-collecting ducts and therefore play a critical role in maintaining the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance.\nOne of the principal functions of connecting tubule epithelial cells involves the selective reabsorption and secretion of various solutes. This reabsorption process includes critical regulatory electrolytes such as sodium ions (Na+), chloride ions (Cl-), and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thus playing a role in the regulation of the acid-base homeostasis. Their function also involves the secretion of potassium ions (K+) into the renal tubular fluid.\nThe connecting tubule epithelial cells are primarily intercalated cells, which can be categorized into two types according to their specific functions: type A intercalated cells, which secrete acid, and the type B intercalated cells, which secrete base (bicarbonate) and reabsorb chloride. By regulating the concentrations of these ions, as well as reabsorption of water, connecting tubule epithelial cells contribute substantively to maintaining the body's electrolyte levels, pH balance, and overall homeostasis.\nIn addition to intercalating cells, the collecting duct system also has principal cells, which are characterized by the expression of the water channel AQP2. AQP2-expressing cells have also been identified in connecting tubules, but there is some controversy whether these represent a unique cell type as there are some morphologic differences compared with principal cells." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/cphy.c110052", xref="DOI:10.1007/s00418-021-02033-5", xref="DOI:10.1097/MNH.0b013e32820ac850", xref="DOI:10.1681/ASN.2019040415", xref="DOI:10.23876/j.krcp.2017.36.4.305"}

The DCT epithelial cells form lining of the distal convoluted tubule, a segment of the nephron located after the loop of Henle and before the collecting tubule.

While the DCT is less prominent in water and sodium reabsorption compared to the proximal tubule and the loop of Henle, it plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the process. DCT epithelial cells are responsible for the final adjustments of sodium, potassium and calcium reabsorption, thereby affecting overall fluid and electrolyte balance, blood pressure regulation and bone health. The reabsorption process is regulated by hormones including aldosterone and parathyroid hormone.\nThe distal convoluted tubule (DCT) also plays a significant role in acid-base homeostasis by secreting protons (H+) into the tubular fluid and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thus regulating the pH of the blood. The ability of DCT cells to adjust urine concentration plays a part in maintaining the body’s pH balance and preventing conditions like acidosis or alkalosis.

When the sodium chloride concentration is high, macula densa cells respond by secreting adenosine and vasoconstricting the afferent arteriole to decrease the glomerular filtration rate. Conversely, if the sodium chloride concentration in the filtrate is low, the production and release of nitric oxide cause vasodilation to enhance the glomerular filtration rate. \nMacula densa epithelial cells also have a role in tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms, an essential autoregulatory renal response.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nIntestinal enteroendocrine cells are a highly specialized cell type found within the gastrointestinal epithelium. They account for approximately 1% of the intestinal epithelial cells in what is known as the largest endocrine organ in the human body. Intestinal enteroendocrine cells exhibit an exceptional diversity, both in terms of their secretory products and their distribution along the intestines, varying from the small intestine to the colon. \nThe primary function of intestinal enteroendocrine cells is to maintain gut physiology and homeostasis. They are known for their hormone production and are the source of numerous bioactive molecules including somatostatin, serotonin, cholecystokinin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, motilin, neurotensin, and others. These hormones and neuropeptides act in autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine signaling, impacting various functions including intestinal motility, secretion, nutrient absorption, and gut barrier functions.\nIntestinal enteroendocrine cells also serve as the body's frontline of defense, playing an integral role in surveillance against lumen-occurring hazards including pathogen attack. Enteroendocrine cells are divided into ‘closed type’ and ‘open type’. Closed type cells are located close to the basal membrane and do not reach the lumen of the gut. In contrast, the apical side of the open-type intestinal enteroendocrine cells is directly exposed to luminal contents and thus can recognize bacterial metabolites and dietary nutrients. In response, these cells can modulate the immune system responses and thereby function as a key communicator between the gut microbiota and the host." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.coph.2013.09.008", xref="DOI:10.1038/mi.2017.73", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41574-019-0168-8", xref="DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2613.2011.00767.x", xref="DOI:10.1146/annurev-physiol-021115-105439"}

These cells are located within the complex tubuloalveolar glands that make up the seminal vesicles and are known for their unique pseudostratified columnar epithelium structure. \nThe primary function of these cells is the secretion of a variety of substances that ultimately constitute around 70% of the fluid volume of semen. Seminal cells produce a high-fructose fluid that serves as an energy source for the spermatozoa and promotes their motility.

Collectively, these substances help in the nourishment, protection, and transportation of the spermatozoa throughout the male reproductive system and during the ejaculation process.\nSecondary to the production of seminal fluid, the seminal vesicle glandular cells also play a role in the contraction of the seminal vesicles during ejaculation. The contraction of these glands, induced by sympathetic nerves, ensures the efficient propulsion of the seminal fluid mixed with spermatozoa into the ejaculatory ducts and subsequently to the urethra.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nCerebral cortex endothelial cells are unique endothelial cells responsible for the formation and regulation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a specialized structure that separates the circulating blood from the cerebral neural tissue. These cells line the inner surface of nearly all blood vessels that irrigate the cerebral cortex, the outermost layer of the brain involved with complex cognitive functions such as thought, perception, and memory formation. Cerebral cortex endothelial cells are integral to maintaining brain health and function due to their role in regulating brain microenvironment and controlling the passage of essential molecules and cells.\nThe endothelial cells in the cerebral cortex are distinctive due to their highly selective permeability, largely attributable to the existence of unique tight junctions which maintain the barrier function of the BBB. The tightly interconnected structures of these cells prevent most substances from freely diffusing into the brain tissue, ensuring that harmful agents such as toxins, pathogens, or peripheral immune cells don't reach the brain and compromise its function. These cells also express multiple transporters and enzymes, allowing the selective entry of necessary nutrients and metabolites while excluding toxic substances.\nCerebral cortex endothelial cells also participate in neurovascular coupling, a process where localized neuronal activity increases cerebral blood flow to satisfy the local metabolic demands. The endothelial cells work in coordination with neurons and other cell types such as astrocytes and pericytes to mediate this process. They have been thought to regulate local blood flow by releasing substances in response to neuronal activity. Additionally, these cells are involved in many pathological conditions. Breakdown or dysfunction of the BBB often marked by altered endothelial cell function is linked to numerous neurological disorders including stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and brain tumors." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/nbt.2247", xref="DOI:10.1038/nrn1824", xref="DOI:10.1177/0271678X156179", xref="DOI:10.1186/s12987-020-00230-3", xref="DOI:10.3389/fnins.2023.1047778"}

They are important in maintaining tissue homeostasis and immunity.\nThe primary function of lung macrophages is to patrol and maintain the pulmonary system, where they serve as the first line of defense against airborne pathogens and inhaled particles.

They may also participate in tissue repair and the resolution of inflammation following injury.\nLung macrophages also play a critical role in immune regulation. They help to initiate an immune response by secreting cytokines and other inflammatory mediators and by presenting antigens from the pathogens they have engulfed to induce T cell responses. However, if activated improperly, lung macrophages can contribute to inflammatory diseases of the lung such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/JLB.3RU0720-418R", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.immuni.2022.08.010", xref="DOI:10.1189/jlb.70.2.163", xref="DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2021.753940/full", xref="DOI:10.3390/cells10040897"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nSebaceous gland cells, also known as sebocytes, are small, oil-producing glands present in the skin of mammals. These specialized cells are predominantly located in the dermis, particularly on the face, scalp, and upper body. \nThe primary function of sebaceous gland cells is the production and secretion of sebum, a complex mixture of lipids including triglycerides, wax esters, squalene, and metabolites of fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin E), as well as free fatty acids. The production process involves a unique form of programmed cell death called holocrine secretion. In this process, as sebaceous gland cells mature, they progressively accumulate lipid droplets, before ultimately disintegrating and releasing their lipid-rich contents into the gland's ductal system. \nThe sebum generated by these cells serves multiple purposes. It acts as a waterproofing agent, preventing excessive wetting or drying of the skin and averaging skin's water-holding capacity. Sebum also has antimicrobial properties, providing a natural defense barrier against certain bacterial and fungal species. Additionally, it contributes to the skin’s suppleness and prevents it from becoming brittle. An overproduction or imbalance of sebaceous gland cells can lead to common skin disorders, such as acne, seborrhea, or rosacea, illustrating their importance in skin health." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.jid.2016.10.017", xref="DOI:10.1080/19381980.2017.1375636", xref="DOI:10.4161/derm.1.2.8472", xref="https://doi.org/10.2147/CLEP.S323744", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/sebum"}

def: "A smooth muscle cell that is part of the fallopian tube. This cell is responsible for peristaltic contractions that facilitate gamete and embryo transport, fluid mixing, and embryo admission to the uterus." [PMID:31183831, PMID:31613440]
comment: The fallopian tube smooth muscle cell in the human contracts dynamically in response to hormones and signaling molecules. Prostaglandins, particularly PGF2α and PGE2, have been shown to increase muscular contractions, while progesterone, levonorgestrel, mifepristone, oxytocin, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) decrease them. These contractile responses are crucial for regulating gamete and embryo transport through the fallopian tube. {xref="PMID:18621753"}
