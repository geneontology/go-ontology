comment: The definition of cell is intended to represent all cells, and thus a cell is defined as a material entity and not an anatomical structure, which implies that it is part of an organism (or the entirety of one).

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nMale germ cells are specialized cells that give rise to the male gametes and are therefore crucial for sexual reproduction in males. Through a complex process called spermatogenesis in the testes male germ cells undergo several stages of development, each with distinctive morphological and physiological characteristics, eventually differentiating into mature spermatozoa (sperm). \nMale germ cells are responsible for transferring genetic material from male to offspring as part of sexual reproduction. In the initial stage of their life cycle, they exist as spermatogonial stem cells, which multiply by mitotic division to self-renew and to produce daughter cells. The daughter cells then undergo meiotic division, a process that reduces the number of chromosomes in each cell by half, from diploid to haploid – the formation of spermatids. This is critical for maintaining genetic stability from generation to generation, as it ensures that when an egg and sperm cell unite during fertilization, the resulting offspring will have the correct number of chromosomes. The final phase of spermatogenesis is called spermiogenesis, during which spermatozoa - mature and motile sperm cells – are produced from round spermatids. \nThe matured male germ cells or sperm cells are highly specialized, having a streamlined shape designed for efficient movement towards the female egg. A sperm cell is divided into three main parts, namely the head, midpiece, and tail. The head contains the genetic material, the midpiece contains mitochondria that provide energy, and the tail, termed as the flagellum, propels the sperm cell forward. Each of these parts play significant roles in fertilization." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81834-6", xref="DOI:10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00173-9", xref="DOI:10.1242/dev.202046", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553142/"}

Produced in the male reproductive organs, specifically the testes, sperm cells play an important role in the process of fertilization, where they fuse with a female gamete or egg cell (ovum) to form a zygote, which marks the beginning of a new organism.\nSperm cells hold several unique traits that set them apart from other body cells. Structurally, a sperm cell possesses two main structures: the head, containing the nucleus carrying the paternal genetic information, and the flagellum, which generates energy and grants the sperm cell mobility\nThe process of fertilization occurs when one sperm cell successfully penetrates the egg, delivering its genetic information, and ultimately leading to the formation of a new individual combining both paternal and maternal genetic materials. Notably, while hundreds of millions of sperm cells may be released during ejaculation, only one has the opportunity to successfully fertilize the egg, underscoring the highly competitive nature of this biological process." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1080/19420889.2015.1017156", xref="DOI:10.1152/physrev.00009.2020", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26914/"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nGametes are reproductive cells essential for sexual reproduction in eukaryotic organisms, including humans, animals, and many plants. These cells are haploid, containing half the genome or only one set of chromosomes, which is a contrast to the diploid state (two sets of chromosomes) found in most cells in a multicellular organism. This reduction in genetic material is crucial since it allows for the re-establishment of the diploid number of chromosomes when two gametes merge to form a diploid zygote during fertilization.\nThere are two major types of gametes in animals: sperm cells in males and egg (or ova) in females. These gametes contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the offspring but are morphologically and functionally distinct. Sperm cells (or spermatozoa) are characterized by their motility, small size, and large quantities; they are produced continuously in vast numbers through a process called spermatogenesis in the male gonads or testes. Female gametes are much larger, fewer in numbers, and are not motile; they undergo a development process known as oogenesis, which takes place within the ovaries. The egg also contributes most of the cytoplasm and organelles (including mitochondria) to the zygote that are required for initial cell division stages after fertilization.\nGametes have a primary role in sexual reproduction and genetic variation, which aids in evolution. The formation of gametes involves a special type of cell division called meiosis that introduces genetic diversity via the process of recombination and independent assortment. Following the fusion of male and female gametes, the combination of paternal and maternal genetic material in the zygote allows for genetic recombination, which is a fundamental source of genetic variation and, thus, evolution. Therefore, gametes not only are critical to the inception of new individuals but also contribute to species survival and evolution." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/s41586-020-2347-0", xref="DOI:10.3389/fcell.2022.1040708", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10008/", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553142/"}

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nThe male gamete, also known as a sperm cell, is a highly specialized cell type critical to sexual reproduction. Sperm are produced during a process called spermatogenesis within the male reproductive organ, specifically the testes. They are haploid cells, carrying the genetic material from the male parent, and fuse with the ovum, the female gamete, to form a diploid zygote during fertilization, thereby initiating gestation and the development of a new organism.\nThe male gamete is distinguished by its morphology, notably its elongated shape which is geared towards locomotion. One of the primary characteristics of a male gamete is its flagellum, or tail, which propels the cell towards the female gamete. It additionally contains an elongated head region housing the nucleus, where the genetic material is stored. The anterior section of the head, the acrosome, releases enzymes essential for penetrating the protective layers of the ovum during the fertilization process.\nThe function of male gametes does not cease upon fertilization. In addition to delivering the paternal set of chromosomes, fusion of the sperm cell with the ovum causes an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ which then activates the female egg cell to undergo the so-called cortical reaction during which the egg’s zona pellucida is changed so fusion with additional sperm is prevented. The Ca2+ signal also initiates the development of the zygote and eventual formation of an embryo.

It may contain information that applies only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nBrush cells, also referred to as tuft cells or multivesicular cells, are a specialized type of epithelial cell mainly noted for their characteristic 'brush border' composed of microvilli. These cells reside in the epithelial lining of tissue organs such as the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and the bile ducts. The name derives from their distinct appearance under the microscope, which resembles a brush due to the dense layer of microvilli protruding into the lumen.\nA key function of brush cells is chemosensation: They express a variety of signaling molecules and receptors that enable them to detect specific chemical stimuli in the environment and act as sensory transducers. Many of these receptors are responsive to luminal content, which makes brush cells vital for regulating and coordinating appropriate physiological responses to changes in these substances. \nRecent research has also elucidated an important role for these cells in immunity. Intestinal brush cells have been found to be the source of a cytokine called interleukin-25, which can initiate type 2 immune responses during parasitic infections. This immune function, along with the chemosensing abilities, signifies that brush cells could serve crucial roles in health and disease, although much research is still required to fully elucidate their myriad roles in physiology and pathology. Overall, brush cells are a versatile cell type, whose distinct morphology and functional capabilities allow them to perform a unique set of functions within the body." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1007/978-3-211-99390-3_83", xref="DOI:10.1038/nature16161", xref="DOI:10.1111/j.1469-7580.2005.00403.x", xref="DOI:10.3389/fphys.2015.00087", xref="DOI:10.5114/ceji.2022.124416"}

These cells play crucial roles in maintaining ion and acid-base homeostasis. Ionocytes demonstrate remarkable plasticity and are able to adapt themselves in response to changes in environmental conditions such as pH, salinity, ion concentration, and temperature.\nThese cells work by selectively absorbing specific ions from the environment, thus maintaining the body's internal ionic balance. The most commonly absorbed ions include sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca2+), and hydrogen (H+). Moreover, ionocytes contribute to acid-base regulation. In response to acidosis or alkalosis, ionocytes can either excrete or retain hydrogen (H+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions to readjust the blood pH. Further, experimental evidence suggests a functional complexity of ionocytes, implying diverse roles beyond ion regulation. Recent research highlights ionocytes' involvement in ammonia excretion and the regulation of extracellular fluid volume, highlighting their contribution to the overall homeostatic process.\nMalfunctioning ionocytes have been implicated in various diseases, including cystic fibrosis which is caused by mutations in the chloride channel CFTR, an ionocyte marker." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.jcf.2019.09.010", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41586-018-0393-7", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41598-023-30603-1", xref="DOI:10.1146/annurev-pathol-042420-094031", xref="DOI:10.3389/fmars.2020.00709"}

comment: Work is needed on GO 'cell differentiation' before it is clear whether the equivalent class definition 'native cell' that capable_of some 'cell differentiation' works. Also, may want to consider merging this with non-terminally differentiated cell.

The dentate gyrus granule cell is the principal cell type of the dentate gyrus." [GOC:TermGenie, PMID:17765709]
