Transition from lateral root primordium to lateral root occurs with the formation of a root cap (PO:0020123), shortly after the development of a root apical meristem (PO:0020147), which can occur before the lateral root penetrates the exterior of the parent root.

id: PO:0000071
name: companion cell
namespace: plant_anatomy
comment: Companion cells are connected to sieve tube elements through plasmodesmata and function in phloem loading of small molecules, including photosynthate (either sucrose or raffinose-family oligosaccharides). May participate in phloem sucrose loading (GO:0009915). Molecules can be loaded into the companion cells from surrounding cells through either symplastic (via plasmodesmata) or apoplastic (transmembrane) transport. Unlike sieve tube elements, companion cells retain their nuclei and other organelles at maturity. A sieve tube element may have one or more or no companion cells associated with it. This term should not be used for other types of parenchyma cells (PO:0000074) that do not arise from the same phloem mother cell as a sieve tube element. Companion cells are found in angiosperms, as compared to albuminous cells (PO:0025412), which are found in non-angiosperm vascular plants. Companion cells may be specialized as transfer companion cells (PO:0025458), ordinary companion cells (PO:0025459), or intermediary companion cells (PO:0025460). Multiple types of companion cells may be found in the same plant.

The secondary cell wall of a sclerenchyma cell is often thicker than other cell types in the same plant structure, but it is not always easy to distinguish from tracheary elements (PO:0000290) or sclerified parenchyma cells (PO:0000074). Compare with collenchyma cells (PO:0000075) that are always alive at maturity, have irregularly thickened primary cell walls, and do not have lignified secondary cell walls. Collenchyma cells provides flexibility while sclerenchyma cells provide hardness. Sclerenchyma cells include plant fiber cells (PO:0025407) and sclerid cells (PO:0025418).

Transition from root primordium to root occurs with the formation of a root cap (PO:0020123), shortly after the development of a root apical meristem (PO:0020147).

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the substrate and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually positively geotropic and found underground, although there are many exceptions such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

comment: The shoot system is generally used to refer to the above-ground plant parts, although some plants have parts of their shoot system underground. For example, a rhizome (PO:0004542), bulb (PO:0025356), a corm (PO:0025355) or a subterranean tuber (PO:0004547), as in Solanum tuberosum (potato) or yam, are all part of the shoot system.

comment: A plant embryo is generally formed after the first division of a plant zygote (PO:0000423), but in the case of a nucellar (adventitious) plant embryo (PO:0004537), somatic plant embryo (PO:0025302), microspore-derived cultured plant embryo (PO:0025305), and other embryos that arise through apogamy, it begins after the division of a single cell that is not a zygote. The end of the embryo stage varies among taxa; the beginning of a seed germination stage (PO:0007057) in seed plants, formation of the first vascular leaf (PO:0009025) in pteridophytes, the beginning of development of a sporangium (PO:0025094) in bryophytes, or the beginning of the formation of a plant organ (PO:0009008) such as a root (PO:0009005), shoot axis (PO:0025029), or vascular leaf (PO:0009025) in a cultured plant embryo (PO:0000010).

Occurs in the sporophytic phase of a plant life cycle.

If carpels are fused, the gynoecium is a syncarpous gynoecium, as in Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Solanaceae. If carpels are free, the gynoecium is an apocarpous gynoecium, as in Fabaceae.

The growth pattern of an inflorescence may be monopodial (single main shoot axis), sympodial (growth only occurs from axillary meristems), or both. An inflorescence axis (PO:0020122) can be determinate or indeterminate. An inflorescence flower pedicel (PO:0009052) is the ultimate axis in an inflorescence. The flower (PO:0009046) of many plants, for example Magnolia spp., is solitary.

A gynoecium with two or more carpels may be either syncarpous (carpels fused) or apopcarpous (carpels free) or the carpels may be partially fused.

In Zea mays, gynoecia of tassel florets and of the lower florets of ear spikelets usually do not develop fully, and they are present in a rudimentary state.

In ferns, lateral root primordia develop from the endodermis.

name: pollen sperm cell

comment: Pollen sperm cells are structurally simple, usually non-motile cells that may contain a normal complement of cellular organelles, including heritable cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and, in some plants, plastids, but lack a cell wall. In seed plants, pollen sperm cells are usually two in number. In angiosperms, during double fertilization, one fuses with the plant egg cell (PO:0020094) to produce a plant zygote (PO:0000423) while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the embryo sac central cell (PO:0020090) to give rise to endosperm (PO:0009089).  In angiosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the generative cell (PO:0020097). In gymnosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the body cell (PO:0025525).

comment: Sieve elements function mainly in longitudinal conduction of organic solutes. Classified into sieve cells (PO:0025415) and sieve tube elements (PO:0000289) based on the presence of sieve plates and specialization of sieve areas in different parts of the cell. Develops from either a cambial initial (PO:0000295), a phloem mother cell (PO:0000400), or a cell of the procambium (PO:0025275).

comment: Sieve areas in sieve cells generally have narrow pores and thin connecting strands, and they are not highly specialized, but instead are fairly uniform throughout the cell wall. Typical of gymnosperms and non-seed vascular plants such as ferns. Differ from sieve tube elements, which have sieve plates and more pronounced specialization of sieve areas.

Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.
