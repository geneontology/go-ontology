comment: A lateral root primordium may arise from cells of a pericycle (PO:0006203) in a root, as in most seed plants (pericyclic lateral root primordium; PO:0025492), or from cells of an endodermis (PO:0000252) or other tissue in ferns and some seed plants (non-pericyclic lateral root primordium: PO:0025493). Transition from lateral root primordium to lateral root occurs with the formation of a root cap (PO:0020123), shortly after the development of a root apical meristem (PO:0020147), which can occur before the lateral root penetrates the exterior of the parent root.

comment: Companion cells are connected to sieve tube elements through plasmodesmata and function in phloem loading of small molecules, including photosynthate (either sucrose or raffinose-family oligosaccharides). May participate in phloem sucrose loading (GO:0009915). Molecules can be loaded into the companion cells from surrounding cells through either symplastic (via plasmodesmata) or apoplastic (transmembrane) transport. Unlike sieve tube elements, companion cells retain their nuclei and other organelles at maturity. A sieve tube element may have one or more or no companion cells associated with it. This term should not be used for other types of parenchyma cells (PO:0000074) that do not arise from the same phloem mother cell as a sieve tube element. Companion cells are found in angiosperms, as compared to albuminous cells (PO:0025412), which are found in non-angiosperm vascular plants. Companion cells may be specialized as transfer companion cells (PO:0025458), ordinary companion cells (PO:0025459), or intermediary companion cells (PO:0025460). Multiple types of companion cells may be found in the same plant.

The secondary cell wall of a sclerenchyma cell is often thicker than other cell types in the same plant structure, but it is not always easy to distinguish from tracheary elements (PO:0000290) or sclerified parenchyma cells (PO:0000074). Compare with collenchyma cells (PO:0000075) that are always alive at maturity, have irregularly thickened primary cell walls, and do not have lignified secondary cell walls. Collenchyma cells provides flexibility while sclerenchyma cells provide hardness. Sclerenchyma cells include plant fiber cells (PO:0025407) and sclerid cells (PO:0025418).

comment: Tracheary elements are dead at maturity, are more or less elongated, and have pits of various types in the cell wall. Tracheary elements function in the conduction of water and dissolved substances such as mineral nutrients from the roots to the shoot system. Tracheary elements can be distinguished from fiber cells (PO:0025407) by the presence of bordered pits, although there are intermediate forms called fiber tracheids (PO:0000355).

comment: Found in heterosporous ferns and seed plants. May also give rise to sterile cells. In the majority of flowering plants, including Arabidopsis, the female archesporial cell elongates and polarizes longitudinally, and directly differentiates into the megasporocyte or megaspore mother cell. In some flowering plants, it undergoes a periclinal division, and subsequently the inner cell differentiates into the megasporocyte.

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the substrate and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually positively geotropic and found underground, although there are many exceptions such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

The end of the embryo stage varies among taxa; the beginning of a seed germination stage (PO:0007057) in seed plants, formation of the first vascular leaf (PO:0009025) in pteridophytes, the beginning of development of a sporangium (PO:0025094) in bryophytes, or the beginning of the formation of a plant organ (PO:0009008) such as a root (PO:0009005), shoot axis (PO:0025029), or vascular leaf (PO:0009025) in a cultured plant embryo (PO:0000010).

comment: In some cases, a gynoecium (PO:0009062) may consist of only one carpel, in which case annotations should go on carpel (PO:0009030). The word pistil is used synonymously with gynoecium, but if a gynoecium consists of a single carpel, then pistil may be used synonymously with carpel. If carpels are fused, the gynoecium is a syncarpous gynoecium, as in Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Solanaceae. If carpels are free, the gynoecium is an apocarpous gynoecium, as in Fabaceae. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352), tassel floret (PO:0006310), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006314), upper floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006316).

comment: An inflorescence is a reproductive shoot system from which at least two flowers develop. The growth pattern of an inflorescence may be monopodial (single main shoot axis), sympodial (growth only occurs from axillary meristems), or both. An inflorescence axis (PO:0020122) can be determinate or indeterminate. An inflorescence flower pedicel (PO:0009052) is the ultimate axis in an inflorescence. The flower (PO:0009046) of many plants, for example Magnolia spp., is solitary.

The development of an androecium in an ear floret of a normal maize plant is aborted and is present in a rudimentary state, while the development of an androecium in a tassel floret leads to a functional androecium.

comment: If annotating gene expression to a gynoecium with a single carpel (PO:0009030), the annotation should go on carpel. A gynoecium with two or more carpels may be either syncarpous (carpels fused) or apopcarpous (carpels free) or the carpels may be partially fused. The word pistil is used synonymously with gynoecium for a synocarpous gynoecium, and synonymously with carpel for an apocarpous gynoecium, whether it has one or more carpels. In Zea mays, gynoecia of tassel florets and of the lower florets of ear spikelets usually do not develop fully, and they are present in a rudimentary state. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type.

def: "A plant sperm cell (PO:0000084) that is part of the pollen (PO:0025281)." [PMID:20298228, POC:curators]
comment: Pollen sperm cells are structurally simple, usually non-motile cells that may contain a normal complement of cellular organelles, including heritable cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and, in some plants, plastids, but lack a cell wall. In seed plants, pollen sperm cells are usually two in number. In angiosperms, during double fertilization, one fuses with the plant egg cell (PO:0020094) to produce a plant zygote (PO:0000423) while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the embryo sac central cell (PO:0020090) to give rise to endosperm (PO:0009089).  In angiosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the generative cell (PO:0020097). In gymnosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the body cell (PO:0025525).

comment: May function in providing nutrition to developing sporocytes or pollen. May have one or more layers of cells. May break down as spores mature. A tapetum does not develop in some plants, such as Psilotum. In angiosperms, the tapetum develops from one of the parietal layers. In non-seed plants, the tapetum may develop from the outer cells of archesporium or from the inner-most layer of the sporangium wall. The tapetum may be one of two types ameboid or secretory/glandular.

Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.
