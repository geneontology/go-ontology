comment: Shapes are invariant on size transformations. Shapes can be subdivided into 2D and 3D shapes, We can also make a distinction between shapes of complete self-connected objects, and shapes of parts of objects.

comment: Relational qualities are qualities that hold between multiple entities. Normal (monadic) qualities such as the shape of a eyeball exist purely as a quality of that eyeball. A relational quality such as sensitivity to light is a quality of that eyeball (and connecting nervous system) as it relates to incoming light waves/particles.
