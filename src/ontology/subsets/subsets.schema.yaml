      This enumeration includes the allowed values

      ExclusionList:
        aliases:
          - Blacklist
          - Anti-slim
        description: Contains a negative set of terms to be excluded for some purpose.
          There is typically no limit to the size of an exclusion list.
      Binning:
        description: Used for rolling up and binning genes.
      Ribbon:
        description: Used for visualization in a ribbon-type display. Ribbons should not include
          terms that are in direct or indirect hierarchical relationship with each other. Ribbons
          also seek to minimize overlap in genes annotated to different terms where possible.

  StatusEnum:
    permissible_values:
      active:
        description: Actively maintained. All terms in the subset are active (not obsolete) in the ontology.

        description: A short human-readable name for the subset. For subsets that
          are based on species on taxonomy this should typically be the common name
          (pluralized) of the taxon. The short label is not guaranteed to be globally
          unique but it must be unique for any given role.
        comments:
          - "The short label may be used in UIs and displays - for example, GO ribbon displays.
             Because it is guaranteed unique within the 'Ribbon' role it will be unambiguous"
