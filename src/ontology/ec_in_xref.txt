def: "OBSOLETE. Catalysis of the reaction: (5-L-glutamyl)-peptide + an amino acid = peptide + 5-L-glutamyl-amino acid." [EC:2.3.2.2]
comment: This term was obsoleted because it does not correspond to a physiological reaction.\nUsage comment: The gene family commonly referred to as gamma-glutamyl transferases (GGT) catalyze hydrolysis of gamma-glutamyl bonds in gamma-glutamyl compounds such as glutathione. In a test tube one can set up conditions in which the enzyme will transfer the gamma-glutamyl portion of the substrate to an acceptor molecule, but this requires non-physiologic conditions, including millmolar concentrations of an acceptor such as glygly. This reaction is used in assays to detect the presence of the enzyme, but is not a physiological function of members of the GGT family (PMC4388159), which should be annotated to a suitable hydrolysis term instead (e.g. glutathione hydrolase activity).

comment: In mammals, L-DOPA can act as a cofactor for the catalyzed reaction; therefore in some resources L-DOPA is shown on both sides of the reaction. GO:0004503 describes the monooxygenation of the monophenol, L-tyrosine. For oxidation of diphenols (including L-DOPA and dopamine), consider instead the term 'catechol oxidase activity ; GO:0004097' and its children.

comment: Take care to annotate to the reaction, not simply the enzyme name. The name "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" has variously been used to refer to two distinctly different enzymes. Both enzymes act on ureidoglycolate and produce glyoxylate, but the mechanism and reaction products are different. The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" listed in the Enzyme commission (EC) is a ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase, releasing ammonia, (EC:3.5.3.19, GO:0004848). The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" characterized in PMID:3915539 (published prior to the EC designation of EC:3.5.3.19) is a ureidoglycolate lyase, releasing urea (EC:4.3.2.3, GO:0050385). The inappropriate labelling of ureidoglycolate lyase as EC:3.5.3.19 has caused much confusion in the literature (see PMID:24107613). Take care to correctly annotate based on the reaction products, rather than name.

comment: Note that the name 'para-amino benzoic acid synthase' was initially given to the 'aminodeoxychorismate synthase' activity before the additional 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase activity was discovered. It is the lyase activity that actually produces para-aminobenzoic acid from 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate.

comment: Note that this term specifically refers to the reaction proceeding in the direction shown; under physiological conditions adrenodoxin reduction by adrenodoxin reductase is coupled with electron transfer from AdR to P450, which catalyzes an irreversible monooxygenation reaction. This term should therefore be used to annotate gene products that catalyze the reduction of oxidized adrenodoxin; also consider annotating to the molecular function term 'ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase activity ; GO:0004324'.

comment: This is based on the finding that L-aspartate oxidase (NadB) of E. coli preferentially uses fumarate as the electron acceptor and does so under anaerobic conditions. The same enzyme uses oxygen as the electron acceptor under aerobic conditions. The EC conflates the two reactions in EC:1.4.3.16 (as they are catalyzed by the same enzyme).

comment: This reaction is achieved by the catalysis of two successive steps carried out by the same enzyme - the transfer of a methyl group from the substrate to the cobalt cofactor of a methylated-thiol-specific corrinoid protein (MtsB), and the subsequent transfer of the methyl group from the corrinoid protein to coenzyme M. With most other methanogenesis substrates this process is carried out by two different enzymes (for example, EC:2.1.1.90, methanol-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase, and EC:2.1.1.246, methylated methanol-specific corrinoid protein:coenzyme M methyltransferase). The cobalt is oxidized during methylation from the Co(I) state to the Co(III) state, and is reduced back to the Co(I) form during demethylation.

def: "Catalysis of the reaction: (S)-ureidoglycolate = glyoxylate + urea." [EC:4.3.2.3, RHEA:11304]
comment: Take care to annotate to the reaction, not simply by enzyme name. Note that the name "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" (listed as a synonym here) has variously been used to refer to two distinctly different enzymes. Both enzymes act on ureidoglycolate and produce glyoxylate, but the mechanism and reaction products are different. The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" listed in the Enzyme commission (EC) is a ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase, releasing ammonia, (EC:3.5.3.19 ; GO:0004848). The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" characterized in PMID:3915539 (published prior to the EC designation of EC:3.5.3.19) is a ureidoglycolate lyase, releasing urea (EC:4.3.2.3 ; GO:0050385). The inappropriate labelling of ureidoglycolate lyase as EC:3.5.3.19 has caused much confusion in the literature (see PMID:24107613). Take care to correctly annotate based on the reaction products, rather than name.
