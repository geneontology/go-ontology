description: This pattern is for classes representing cell–cell signaling, differentiated by the start and end cell types.

classes:
  cell: "CL:0000000"
  cell-cell signaling: "GO:0007267"

relations:
  has start location: "RO:0002231"
  has end location: "RO:0002232"

vars:
  start: "'cell'"
  end: "'cell'"

name:

def:
  text: "Cell-cell signaling that mediates the transfer of information from a %s to a %s."

equivalentTo:
